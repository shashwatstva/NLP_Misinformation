enormous potential waiting to be unleashedwe live in a time of extraordinary opportunity breakthroughs in science technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solvebut each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanityauthority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values the systems and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since world war iiinternational criminal networks traffic drugs weapons people force dislocation and mass migration threaten our borders and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizensto put it simply we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril it is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepairwe have it in our power should we so choose to lift millions from poverty to help our citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence hatred and fearthis institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future it was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty preserve their security and promote their prosperityit was in the same period exactly 70 years ago that the united states developed the marshall plan to help restore europe those three beautiful pillars they re pillars of peace sovereignty security and prosperitythe marshall plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong independent and free as president truman said in his message to congress at that time our support of european recovery is in full accord with our support of the united nations the success of the united nations depends upon the independent strength of its members to overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future we must begin with the wisdom of the past our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security prosperity and peace for themselves and for the worldwe do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures traditions or even systems of government but we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation this is the beautiful vision of this institution and this is foundation for cooperation and successstrong sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values different cultures and different dreams not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respectstrong sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny and strong sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by godin america we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch this week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example we are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved constitution the oldest constitution still in use in the world todaythis timeless document has been the foundation of peace prosperity and freedom for the americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature human dignity and the rule of lawthe greatest in the united states constitution is its first three beautiful words they are we the people generations of americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words the promise of our country and of our great history in america the people govern the people rule and the people are sovereign i was elected not to take power but to give power to the american people where it belongsin foreign affairs we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty our government s first duty is to its people to our citizens to serve their needs to ensure their safety to preserve their rights and to defend their valuesas president of the united states i will always put america first just like you as the leaders of your countries will always and should always put your countries first applauseall responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens and the nationstate remains the best vehicle for elevating the human conditionbut making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all peoplethe united states will forever be a great friend to the world and especially to its allies but we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a onesided deal where the united states gets nothing in return as long as i hold this office i will defend america s interests above all elsebut in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign prosperous and secureamerica does more than speak for the values expressed in the united nations charter our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall america s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies from the beaches of europe to the deserts of the middle east to the jungles of asiait is an eternal credit to the american character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others instead we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty security and prosperity for allfor the diverse nations of the world this is our hope we want harmony and friendship not conflict and strife we are guided by outcomes not ideology we have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals interests and valuesthat realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room it is a question we cannot escape or avoid we will slide down the path of complacency numb to the challenges threats and even wars that we face or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrowif we desire to lift up our citizens if we aspire to the approval of history then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent we must protect our nations their interests and their futures we must reject threats to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow and just as the founders of this body intended we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos turmoil and terrorthe scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based they respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countriesif the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become bystanders to history the forces of destruction only gather power and strengthno one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in north korea it is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of north koreans and for the imprisonment torture killing and oppression of countless morewe were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent american college student otto warmbier was returned to america only to die a few days later we saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport we know it kidnapped a sweet 13yearold japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for north korea s spiesif this is not twisted enough now north korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human lifeit is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict no nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missilesthe united states has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime the united states is ready willing and able but hopefully this will not be necessary that s what the united nations is all about that s what the united nations is for let s see how they doit is time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future the united nations security council recently held two unanimous 150 votes adopting hardhitting resolutions against north korea and i want to thank china and russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions along with all of the other members of the security council thank you to all involvedbut we must do much more it is time for all nations to work together to isolate the kim regime until it ceases its hostile behaviorwe face this decision not only in north korea it is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime one that speaks openly of mass murder vowing death to america destruction to israel and ruin for many leaders and nations in this roomthe iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy it has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence bloodshed and chaos the longestsuffering victims of iran s leaders are in fact its own peoplerather than use its resources to improve iranian lives its oil profits go to fund hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent muslims and attack their peaceful arab and israeli neighbors this wealth which rightly belongs to iran s people also goes to shore up bashar alassad s dictatorship fuel yemen s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire middle eastwe cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program applause the iran deal was one of the worst and most onesided transactions the united states has ever entered into frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the united states and i don t think you ve heard the last of it believe meit is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction it is time for the regime to free all americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained and above all iran s government must stop supporting terrorists begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighborsthe entire world understands that the good people of iran want change and other than the vast military power of the united states that iran s people are what their leaders fear the most this is what causes the regime to restrict internet access tear down satellite dishes shoot unarmed student protestors and imprison political reformersoppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice will they continue down the path of poverty bloodshed and terror or will the iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization culture and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once againthe iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financingin saudi arabia early last year i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 arab and muslim nations we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires themwe will stop radical islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire worldwe must deny the terrorists safe haven transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology we must drive them out of our nations it is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al qaeda hezbollah the taliban and others that slaughter innocent peoplethe united states and our allies are working together throughout the middle east to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our peoplelast month i announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in afghanistan from now on our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politiciansi have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the taliban and other terrorist groups in syria and iraq we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of isis in fact our country has achieved more against isis in the last eight months than it has in many many years combinedwe seek the deescalation of the syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people the actions of the criminal regime of bashar alassad including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens even innocent children shock the conscience of every decent person no society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread that is why the united states carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attackwe appreciate the efforts of united nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from isis and we especially thank jordan turkey and lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the syrian conflictthe united states is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort we seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding processfor the cost of resettling one refugee in the united states we can assist more than 10 in their home region out of the goodness of our hearts we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible this is the safe responsible and humanitarian approachfor decades the united states has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere we have learned that over the long term uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countriesfor the sending countries it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reformsfor the receiving countries the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by lowincome citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and governmenti want to salute the work of the united nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes the united nations and african union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in africa the united states continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance including famine prevention and relief in south sudan somalia and northern nigeria and yemenwe have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like pepfar which funds aids relief the president s malaria initiative the global health security agenda the global fund to end modern slavery and the women entrepreneurs finance initiative part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globewe also thank applause we also thank the secretary general for recognizing that the united nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty security and prosperity too often the focus of this organization has not been on results but on bureaucracy and processin some cases states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them for example it is a massive source of embarrassment to the united nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the un human rights councilthe united states is one out of 193 countries in the united nations and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more in fact we pay far more than anybody realizes the united states bears an unfair cost burden but to be fair if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals especially the goal of peace this investment would easily be well worth itmajor portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell but the powerful people in this room under the guidance and auspices of the united nations can solve many of these vicious and complex problemsthe american people hope that one day soon the united nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world in the meantime we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regionsthat is why in the western hemisphere the united states has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the cuban people to live in freedom my administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the cuban government until it makes fundamental reformswe have also imposed tough calibrated sanctions on the socialist maduro regime in venezuela which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapsethe socialist dictatorship of nicolas maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country this corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried to make matters worse maduro has defied his own people stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rulethe venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing their democratic institutions are being destroyed this situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watchas a responsible neighbor and friend we and all others have a goal that goal is to help them regain their freedom recover their country and restore their democracy i would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the venezuelan peoplethe united states has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable we are prepared to take further action if the government of venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the venezuelan peoplewe are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the latin american countries gathered here today our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighborsi ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis we call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in venezuela applausethe problem in venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented applause from the soviet union to cuba to venezuela wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systemsamerica stands with every person living under a brutal regime our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action all people deserve a government that cares for their safety their interests and their wellbeing including their prosperityin america we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocalfor too long the american people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success but as those promises flowed millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared others gamed the system and broke the rules and our great middle class once the bedrock of american prosperity was forgotten and left behind but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten againwhile america will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government the duty of our citizens this bond is the source of america s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here todayif this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us it will depend as president truman said some 70 years ago on the independent strength of its members if we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together there can be no substitute for strong sovereign and independent nations nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies nations that seek allies to befriend not enemies to conquer and most important of all nations that are home to patriots to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spiritin remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they lovedpatriotism led the poles to die to save poland the french to fight for a free france and the brits to stand strong for britaintoday if we do not invest ourselves our hearts and our minds in our nations if we will not build strong families safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves no one can do it for uswe cannot wait for someone else for faraway countries or faroff bureaucrats we can t do it we must solve our problems to build our prosperity to secure our futures or we will be vulnerable to decay domination and defeatthe true question for the united nations today for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one are we still patriots do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures do we revere them enough to defend their interests preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizensone of the greatest american patriots john adams wrote that the american revolution was effected before the war commenced the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people that was the moment when america awoke when we looked around and understood that we were a nation we realized who we were what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend from its very first moments the american story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their futurethe united states of america has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the

washington reuters  us president donald trumps administration said on monday that russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries globally but stopped short of accusing moscow of meddling in the 2016 us election the criticism of russia laid out in a new national security strategy based on trumps america first vision reflects a view long held by us diplomats that russia actively undermines american interests at home and abroad despite trumps own bid for warmer ties with president vladimir putin through modernized forms of subversive tactics russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world said the document it avoided directly citing what us intelligence agencies say was russian meddling in last years us presidential election russia uses information operations as part of its offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe its influence campaigns blend covert intelligence operations and false online personas with statefunded media thirdparty intermediaries and paid social media users or trolls the document said trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations with putin even though russia has frustrated us policy in syria and ukraine and done little to help washington in its standoff with north korea in a speech laying out his strategy trump noted that he received a call from putin on sunday to thank him for providing us intelligence that helped thwart a bomb attack in the russian city of st petersburg trump said the collaboration was the way its supposed to work but while we seek such opportunities of cooperation we will stand up for ourselves and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before he said at the ronald reagan building in downtown washington the audience of about 650 people frequently applauded the speech it included the militarys joint chiefs of staff several cabinet secretaries lawmakers military personnel and officials from the intelligence community and other agencies a us justice department investigation is looking into whether trump campaign aides colluded with russia something that moscow and trump both deny us intelligence agencies have concluded russians tried to tip the election to trump through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda facebook google and twitter inc are facing a backlash after saying russians used their services to anonymously spread divisive messages among americans in the runup to the election other western nations including france have accused russia of trying to interfere in their elections congress mandates that every us administration set out its national security strategy the new trump strategy is influenced strongly by the thinking of top national security officials rather than that of the president himself said one official involved in preparing the document the republican presidents strategy reflects his america first priorities of protecting the us homeland and borders rebuilding the military projecting strength abroad and pursuing trade policies more favorable to the united states talking points sent to us embassies worldwide on what diplomats should say about the new strategy makes clear that the official us position is tough on russia an unclassified state department cable seen by reuters said russia tries to weaken the credibility of americas commitment to europe with its invasions of georgia and ukraine russia has demonstrated a willingness to use force to challenge the sovereignty of states in the regionharry kazianis an analyst at the conservative center for the national interest think tank said while things with moscow might be warm and fuzzy for the moment president putin will not take too kindly to being labeled as what essentially amounts to as an enemy of america it drops democratic former president barack obamas 2016 description of climate change as a us national security threat aides said trump has vowed to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord unless changes are made to it the trump administration lumps together china and russia as competitors seeking to challenge us power and erode its security and prosperity the singling out of china and russia as revisionist powers also comes despite trumps own attempts to build strong relations chinese president xi jinping a senior administration official said russia and china were attempting to revise the global status quo  russia in europe with its military incursions into ukraine and georgia and china in asia by its aggression in the south china sea russia denies the allegations that it meddled with the 2016 us presidential election trump has

pride month observance makin island is homeported in san diego us navy photo by mass communication specialist 2nd class eric zeak published at wikicommons21st century wire says while military forces are fighting one enemy in the theatre of combat another multifront culture war is also being fought within their institutions according to a recent report in militarycom us military lawyers have begun speaking about how sexual assault cases are flooding the military courts threatening to break the back of the military s legal system and perhaps radically alter the institutional cultureafter the release of the documentary the invisible war the issue of sexual assault in the military has again been thrust into the national spotlight claiming that 1 in 5 us female veterans have sustained some form of sexual assaultthe issue of sexual assault in the us military first rose to national prominence in 1992 with the emergence of the infamous tailhook scandal one likely reason for this new spike in reported cases could be because each military service branch has recently implemented new awareness programs as well as sexual assault prevention campaigns which actively encourage female troops to report anything they might feel constitutes sexual harassment or a constitutes a sexual assaultthis also comes at a time where the us military has undergone the gradual process of becoming more gay friendly in order to advance issues of equality and to cater for its growing ranks of lgbt service men and womenmilitarycom explains how the new liberal progressive agenda may be adversely affecting operations military lawyers said the pentagon leadership has the right intentions but these prevention campaigns have flooded military court rooms with so many sexual assault cases it s made it harder to prosecute guilty sexual predatorsprosecutors lack witnesses or strong evidence in the majority of cases making it hard to yield a conviction said michael waddington a military defense lawyer and former judge advocate in the army he sees too many cases that involve alcohol and depend on hearsaythe military has the resources to take many sexual assault cases to court said philip cave a military defense lawyer and retired navy lawyer waddington estimated that ninety percent of the sexual assault cases taken to courtmartial would be thrown out in a civilian court because of a lack of evidenceas a result the military are now trying various other different initiatives to try and cope with a problem which to have spun out of controlrt international reports promoting empathy and cracking down on hypermasculinity may help the department of defense to reduce unwanted sexual behavior and improve combat readiness a new government report on sexual violence in the military saysunwanted sexual behaviors such as sexual harassment sexual assault and domestic violence undermine core values unit cohesion combat readiness and public goodwill says the report published this month by the government accountability office gao and signed by brenda farrell director of defense capabilities and managementthe report pointed out that interconnected inappropriate behaviors are part of a continuum of harm that creates a climate conducive to sexual harassment assault and violence the national defense authorization act ndaa for fiscal year 2017 expanded the definition of sexual harassment in the military beyond sex discrimination to make it an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault both the pentagon and the separate service branches have yet to update their policies to reflect this new definition the gao foundthe report also urged the pentagon to incorporate the guidelines for preventing and dealing with sexual violence developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdcthe pentagon is ignoring risk factors identified by the cdc such as alcohol and drug use hypermasculinity emotionally unsupportive family environments general tolerance of sexual violence within the community and societal norms that support male superiority and sexual entitlement the report saysnewport ri oct 29 2010 gunnery sgt duncan hurst encourages an officer candidate to properly perform pushups during the first week of the 12week officer candidate school at naval station

dod are protective factors such as emotional health and connectedness and empathy and concern for how one s actions affect others cdc s research has also established that survivors of one form of violence are more likely to be victims of other forms of violence that survivors of violence are at higher risk for behaving violently and that people who behave violently are more likely to commit other forms of violence the gao report notes apparently seeking to make a distinction between violence in authorized military conflict and personal violencenoting that the dod instructed the services in 2014 to develop mechanisms for reporting incidents of sexual harassment anonymously the gao said that such mechanisms are not yet part of the departmentwide sexual violence policiesadditionally each service branch uses a different database format to record formal complaints of sexual harassment the navy uses excel spreadsheets for example while the gao does not go as far as to recommend a single database the report does advocate improving and standardizing data collection so that the department of defense can further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted sexual behaviors having a single standard across service branches would also be helpful the gao report says noting that the us marine corps usmc updated its standards of conduct in may the usmc made the change in response to the marines united scandal where current and former members posted nude photos of female recruits in a facebook group along with disparaging comments while the marines now consider posting nude photos of others without consent to be harassment other service branches do not as of yetthe gao report comes at a time of renewed interest in sexual harassment in the us

reuters  democraticleaning states may take legal action to challenge the cap on deductions of state and local taxes under the sweeping overhaul of the us tax code and even though such lawsuits would face long odds they could help galvanize democrats for next years midterm election the us tax bill passed by republicans in congress on wednesday limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes known as salt to 10000 the provision hits hardest democraticleaning states with high incomes high property values and high taxes like new york new jersey and california law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states rights under the us constitution some political strategists see a win for democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the republican party its a nobrainer for them to do this said democratic political consultant phil singer failing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice new jersey governorelect phil murphy said during an appearance on cnbc on wednesday that everything is on the table for new jersey to oppose the bill including challenging its legality and constitutionality the governors of california and new york jerry brown and andrew cuomo have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits their offices did not return requests for comment on wednesday since president donald trump took office blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the presidents agenda suing over his proposed travel ban environmental policies and other measures william oreilly a conservative political consultant in new york said the salt deduction issue would likely add to republicans suburbia problem among collegeeducated voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections they already had one because of this presidents style oreilly said darien shanske a tax law professor at the university of california davis school of law said the governors would probably argue that restricting the salt deduction which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in 1862 violates the us constitutions 10th amendment that protects states rights shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the us supreme courts historically broad interpretations of congress 16th amendment power to impose taxes as a general matter nothing prevents the federal government from changing the salt deduction said david gamage a professor of tax law at indiana universitys maurer school of law in a frequently cited 1934 decision the supreme court called tax deductions a legislative grace rather than a right and said congress has broad leeway to abolish them the court reiterated this view in a 1988 decision allowing congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds kirk stark a professor of tax law at the university of california los angeles school of law said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the salt deduction could gain traction courts create new law all the time he said noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political but some legal experts noted that the states rights argument is more typically a conservative position using it to challenge the salt provision could be a move that democratic governors come to regret in the future said daniel hemel a professor at the university of chicago law school the progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the supreme court not getting in the way of that hemel said ,1,1

nicolas j s davies consortium newsseventyseven million people in north and south korea find themselves directly in the line of fire from the threat of a second korean war the rest of the world is recoiling in horror from the scale of civilian casualties such a war would cause and the unthinkable prospect that either side might actually use nuclear weaponssince the first korean war killed at least 20 percent of north korea s population and left the country in ruins the us has repeatedly failed to follow through on diplomacy to establish a lasting peace in korea and has instead kept reverting to illegal and terrifying threats of war most significantly the us has waged a relentless propaganda campaign to discount north korea s legitimate defense concerns as it confronts the threat of a us war machine that has only grown more dangerous since the last time it destroyed north koreathe north has lived under this threat for 65 years and has watched iraq and libya destroyed after they gave up their nuclear weapons programs when north korea discovered a us plan for a second korean war on south korea s military computer network in september 2016 its leaders quite rationally concluded that a viable nuclear deterrent is the only way to guarantee their country s safetywhat does it say about the role the us is playing in the world that the only way north korea s leaders believe they can keep their own people safe is to develop weapons that could kill millions of americansthe changing face of warthe second world war was the deadliest war ever fought with at least 75 million people killed about five times as many as in the first world war when the slaughter ended in 1945 world leaders signed the united nations charter to try to ensure that that scale of mass killing and destruction would never happen again the un charter is still in force and it explicitly prohibits the threat or use of military force by any nationit was not just the scale of the slaughter that shocked the world s leaders into that brief moment of sanity in 1945 it was also the identities of the dead twothirds of the people killed in the second world war were civilians a drastic change from the first world war only a few decades earlier when an estimated 86 percent of the people killed were uniformed combatants the use of nuclear weapons by the united states raised the specter that future wars could kill an exponentially greater numbers of civilians or even end human civilization altogetherwar had become total war no longer fought only on battlefields between soldiers but between entire societies with ordinary people their homes and their lives now on the front line in the second world war fleets of warplanes deliberately bombed cities to dehouse civilian populations as british officials described their own bombing of germany as i write this george orwell wrote from london in 1941 highly civilized human beings are flying overhead trying to kill me submarines sank hundreds of merchant ships in an effort to starve their enemies into submission general carter clarke who was in charge of interpreting japanese intelligence for president truman said in a 1959 interview that japan surrendered because it faced mass starvation due to the sinking of its merchant shipping not because of the gratuitous us nuclear attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki it was estimated that 7 million more civilians would die of starvation if japan fought on until 1946 genocidal mass extermination campaigns killed civilians based only on their political affiliation or ethnicity under crossexamination by a young american prosecutor benjamin ferencz ss gruppenfuhrer dr otto ohlendorf explained patiently to a courtroom in nuremberg why he found it necessary for the preemptive defense of germany to order the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians he explained that even children had to be killed to prevent them too becoming enemies of germany when they grew up and found out what happened to their parentsdespite the un charter and international efforts to prevent war people in countries afflicted by war today still face the kind of total war that horrified world leaders in 1945 the main victims of total war in our modern world have been civilians in countries far removed from the safe havens of power and privilege where their fates are debated and decided yugoslavia afghanistan iraq somalia pakistan yemen libya syria ukraine there has been no legal or political accountability for the mass destruction of their cities their homes or their lives total war has not been prevented or even punished just externalizedbut thanks to billions of dollars invested in military propaganda and public relations and the corrupt nature of forprofit media systems citizens of the countries responsible for the killing of millions of their fellow human beings live in neartotal ignorance of the mass killing carried out in their name in these red zones around the worldpeople in everspreading war zones are living under the very conditions of total war that the world recoiled from at the end of the second world war like orwell in london in 1941 they hear highly civilized human beings flying overhead trying to kill them human beings who know nothing about them beyond the name of the city where they live and its strategic value in wars that offer them the victims nothing but death or destitutionin the case of drones the human beings trying to kill them from the other side of the world are so highly civilized that they can hop into cars and drive home to have dinner with their families at the end of their shifts while another team member efficiently takes over the joystick and carries on killingpeople in yemen syria iraq and libya

everyone suspected the sketchy steele dossier was what corrupt fbi and doj officials used to get the october 2016 fisa warrant against trump fbi and doj officials refuse to answer that question publiclyrep ron desantis rfl said in a statement we now know that the socalled steele dossier was paid for by the democratic party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding thencandidate trump what the american people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by steele on the democrats dime was used by the obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against trump associates the fbi has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of congress the trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against trump or his associates immediately after his inauguration president trump came out swinging over the fake russian dossier he even went as far as to blame the intelligence community president trump was immediately criticized for his comments and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory as it turns out he wasn t too far off the markct despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question and despite numerous oncamera questions to fbi and doj officials about the 2016 fisa process noone had definitively confirmed the christopher steele russian dossier was the underlying evidence for the 2016 fisa application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate donald trump until nowsenator lindsey graham just confirmed the sketchy steele dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the fisa court brian kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it watch at starting at the 0410 mark the backstory to the fisa warrant is the cornerstone the backstory contains both the fbi and the doj scheme expose it remove it and the entire muh russia conspiracy collapses under the weight of sunlight this is critical and important because the specific use of the steele dossier underpins the big ugly and exposes the entire toptier apparatus of the fbi counterintelligence division peter strzok bill priestap james baker andrew mccabe and the doj national security division john carlin stuart evans mary mccord and sally yates as well as doj bruce ohr and fbi lawyer lisa page directly to conspiracy chargesthe 2016 fbi counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the trump campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a fisa warrant sold as a defense of us democracy from russia which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etcthe doj involvement surrounds legal arguments processing of fisa applications and use of the legal system to support the fbi operation with actionable legal framing against trump the doj national security division carried out that collaboration with the fbitablet mag did a deep dive into the fusiongps connection to the creation of the steele dossier and more specifically how fusiongps head glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the white house prior to the doj and fbi applying for the fisa warrant see heretablet mag outlines how mary jacoby even bragged about getting the russiagate narrative starteda tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the nowfamous dossier suggests that central elements of the russiagate scandal emerged not from the british exspy christopher steele s topsecret sources in the russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from russian government control but from a series of stories that fusion gps cofounder glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby cowrote for thewall street journal well before fusion gps existed and donald trump was simply another loudmouthed manhattan real estate millionaireunderstanding the origins of the steele dossier is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the united states  in a facebook post from june 24 2017 that tablet has seen in screenshots jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for russiagate she has not replied to repeated requests for comment it s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what glenn s role was in exposing putin s control of donald trump jacoby wrote let s be clear glenn conducted the investigation glenn hired chris steele chris steele worked for glenn this assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the steele dossier on which the russiagate narrative is founded read morethe tabletmag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished steele dossier entering into the white house and how president obama likely saw and reviewed the contenthowever missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefariousremember previous media reporting in conjunction with clinton campaign admissions have confirmed the dnc and clinton campaign financed fusiongps through their lawyers within perkins coie fusion then hired nellie ohr the wife of doj deputy bruce ohr who thereafter subcontracted with retired british mi6 agent christopher steele to writeresearchprovide credibility for the dossier the dates here are important because they tell a storythe origin of the clinton effort with fusiongps was april 2016 that s the same month fusion hired nellie ohr wife of doj deputy bruce ohr to gather opposition research on candidate trump it would be most likely that nellie ohr was in contact with christopher steele doj deputy attorney bruce ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with christopher steele and fusiongps founder glenn simpson in october 2016 the same month the fisa warrant was grantedhowever there was another event in this april 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the dossier origination hat tip katica check this outin april 2016 mary jacoby shows up on white house visitor logs meeting with president obama

slick georgetown law grad running in gop circles since the reagan campaign manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people i would only add here that in my personal experience journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written especially stories with a character like manafort at the centerso when the trump campaign named paul manafort as its campaign convention manager on march 28 2016 you can bet that simpson and jacoby s eyes lit up and as it happened at the exact same time that trump hired manafort fusion gps was in negotiations with perkins coie the law firm representing the clinton campaign and the dnc to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the trump campaign they had started for the

just days after the death of his own son in combat lt gen john kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable mannertwo years ago when i was the commander of all us and iraqi forces in fact the 22nd of april 2008 two marine infantry battalions 19 the walking dead and 28 were switching out in ramadi one battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon the other just starting its sevenmonth combat tourtwo marines corporal jonathan yale and lance corporal jordan haerter 22 and 20 years old respectively one from each battalion were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 marinesthe same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 iraqi police also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in ramadi a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by al qaeda yale was a dirt poor mixedrace kid from virginia with a wife and daughter and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well he did this on a yearly salary of less than 23000 haerter on the other hand was a middle class white kid from long islandthey were from two completely different worlds had they not joined the marines they would never have met each other or understood that multiple america s exist simultaneously depending on one s race education level economic status and where you might have been born but they were marines combat marines forged in the same crucible of marine training and because of this bond they were brothers as close or closer than if they were born of the same womanthe mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader i am sure went something like okay you two clowns stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass you clear i am also sure yale and haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like yes sergeant with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words no kidding sweetheart we know what we re doing they then relieved two other marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of joint security station nasser in the sophia section of ramadi al anbar iraqa few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 6070 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls the truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated killing them both catastrophically twentyfour brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed a mosque 100 yards away collapsed the truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stoppedour explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2000 pounds of explosives two died and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their dna to run from danger they saved 150 of their iraqi and american brothersinarmswhen i read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened i called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat we expect marines regardless of rank or mos to stand their ground and do their duty and even die in the process if that is what the mission takes but this just seemed differentthe regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed but reported that there were no american witnesses to the event just iraqi police i figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two marines to acknowledge their bravery i d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eyewitnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in washington would never buy iraqi statements if it had any chance at all it had to come under the signature of a general officeri traveled to ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a halfdozen iraqi police all of whom told the same story the blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine they all said we knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two marines began firing the iraqi police then related that some of them also fired and then to a man ran for safety just prior to the explosionall survived many were injured some seriously one of the iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said they d run like any normal man would to save his life what he didn t know until then he said and what he learned that very instant was that marines are not normal choking past the emotion he said sir in the name of god no sane man would have stood there and done what they did no sane man they saved us all what we didn t know at the time and only learned a couple of days later after i wrote a summary and submitted both yale and haerter for posthumous navy crosses was that one of our security cameras damaged initially in the blast recorded some of the suicide attack it happened exactly as the iraqis had described it it took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonatedyou can watch the last six seconds of their young lives putting myself in their heads i supposed it took about a second for the two marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley exactly no time to talk it over or call the sergeant to ask what they should do only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass the two marines had about five seconds left to live it took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons take aim and open up by this time the truck was halfway through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time here the recording shows a number of iraqi police some of whom had fired their aks now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the marines they had three seconds left to livefor about two seconds more the recording shows the marines weapons firing nonstop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the sonofabitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers american and iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two marines standing their ground if they had been aware they would have know they were safe because two marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomberthe recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two marines in all of the instantaneous violence yale and haerter never hesitated by all reports and by the recording they never stepped back they never even started to step aside they never even shifted their weight with their feet spread shoulder width apart they leaned into the danger firing as fast as they could work their weapons they had only one second left to livethe truck explodes the camera goes blank two young men go to their godsix secondsnot enough time to think about their families their country their flag or about their lives or their deaths but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty into eternity that is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you ,0,0

friday on msnbc climate activist bill nye warned conservatives to watch out saying progressive blue states will address climate change on their ownnye said only 40 percent of people in the us think that congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups especially from the fossil fuel industry have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty plus or minus two percent is the same as plus or minus 100 percent he continued there s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writlarge states rights just watch out conservatives if states rights include california illinois new york these places that where people voted in a progressive fashion watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions either overtly or by default on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way he added we ve got to remind people that we re all in this together the people i think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies we want to engage everybody not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest it is not in the best interest especially of your children and grandchildren a couple of times you mentioned that i am against the president and so on i m not especially against the president i just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future this is true not just with regard to the national debt which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved ronald reagan not only will that national debt increase but the climate debt in a sense what we have to do to address climate change will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down breitbart newsthe climate change debate went nuclear last year over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the national oceanic and atmospheric association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming pause in an article on the climate etc blog john bates who retired last year as principal scientist of the national climatic data center accused the lead author of the 2015 noaa pausebuster report of trying to discredit the hiatus through flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards in addition mr bates told the daily uk mail that the report s author former noaa national centers for environmental information director thomas karl did so by insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation gradually in the months after the report came out the evidence kept mounting that tom karl constantly had his thumb on the scale in the documentation scientific choices and release of datasets in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy mr bates said saturday on climate etcthe june 2015 report possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus which updated the ocean temperature record was published six months before the un s paris summitthe accusations sparked a fierce backandforth sunday between socalled climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of mr bates claim which he defended on the climate etc blog run by former georgia tech climatologist judith curryzeke hausfather berkeley earth climate scientist said in a sunday factcheck on the carbonbrief blog that the karl paper s conclusions have been validated by independent data from satellites buoys and argo floats and many other independent groups while noaa s data management procedures may well need improvement their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups mr hausfather said citing berkeley earth and the uk s met office hadley centrehe said the record strongly suggests that noaa got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years meanwhile the whistleblowing prompted a wetoldyouso moment from republicans on the house science space and technology committee who have long suspected the obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 19982013 pause in global temperature increases now that dr bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within noaa about the quality and transparency of the data before publication we know why noaa fought transparency and oversight at every turn said chairman lamar smith in a sunday statementthe panel launched an investigation into the noaa pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the socalled clean power plan and upcoming paris climate conference dr bates revelations and noaa s obstruction certainly lend credence to what i ve expected all along that the karl study used flawed data was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored noaa s own standards for scientific study mr smith saidmr bates said he decided to come forward after reading a washington post article dec 13 that said federal scientists are frantically copying us climate data fearing it might vanish under trump as a climate scientist formerly responsible for noaa s climate archive the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data he said on climate etcin his experience the most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of tom karl et al 2015 hereafter referred to as the karl study or k15 purporting to show no hiatus in global warming in the 2000s noaa did not return immediately sunday a request for comment the daily mail said that mr karl admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published but denied trying to influence the climate summit asked why he had not waited he said john bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time he denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for paris saying there was no discussion about paris said the daily mail articlethe american geophysical union issued a statement saying it was

reports indicated that ashe died of a heart attackthe problem however is that police on the scene reported ashe died when his throat was crushed during a workout accidentadding to the mysterious

meant amputation for a lot of peoplelorich described amputation in those conditions as a death sentence and hoped to treat as many sufferers as possible saying we expected many amputations but we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable particularly those of children we recognized that in an underdeveloped country a limb amputation may be a death sentence it does not have to be so

dealings in haiti while he was still in office to his credit candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the clinton s who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white housesansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to side with the clinton administration and he would be the richest man in haiti he also demanded that hillary clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the haiti earthquake crisis as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation not even 2 of that money went back to haiti so mr trump we are asking you begging you the haitian community will side with you if one day you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in 2010 after the

atlanta reuters  the two democratic candidates running for governor in georgia are both lawyers and former state legislators both are women and on many policy issues its hard to tell them apart both even share the same first name  stacey but they sharply disagree on the path to victory stacey abrams 44 wants to become the first african american female governor in the united states by mobilizing solidly democratic black voters who vote sporadically in elections to form a winning coalition with white liberals stacey evans 39 thinks the math does not add up without also appealing to white moderates many of them outside urban areas who voted for president donald trump last november she is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the democratic party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent democratic victories in alabama and virginia as the party prepares for the 2018 congressional elections there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on  minority voters who are a fastgrowing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots or bluecollar and suburban whites who swing between parties graphic tmsnrtrs2yykchv reuters interviews with liberal activist groups some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on abrams strategy as the best shot at turning a republican state underscoring the stakes in georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left their level of early support for abrams is largely unparalleled among other 2018 gubernatorial and many congressional races a dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind abrams according to a reuters tally even though the democratic primary or nominating contest is still months away the breadth of that support has been little reported abrams who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the south argues that democrats have wasted resources on swing voters we have left too many voters untouched she said in an interview noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion gay rights and labor unions to appeal to republicanleaning voters her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views but you are going to have to persuade some moderate republicans to vote for you if you are going to win in georgia said evans who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another after losing the white house last year the democratic party found itself powerless in washington some in the party faulted their presidential nominee hillary clinton for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states others blamed her inability to connect with working class white voters who were once democratic minorities supported the democratic ticket by wide margins in 2016 but turnout was flat among hispanics and sharply lower among african americans according to the pew research center only half of georgias black voters cast ballots in 2016 compared to more than twothirds of whites a reuters review of state records showed the democratic national committee said the recent wins in alabama and virginia show that democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a party jennifer duffy a political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report said boosting democratic turnout could work as a strategy but she urged caution  focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate democrats and swing voters especially in suburban areas also played a role in the recent democratic victories she noted university of georgia political science professor charles bullock agreed the numbers are there if democrats do not lose more white voters at the abrams campaign headquarters a poster titled how we win points out that democrats in georgia have lost recent elections by some 200000 votes more than 1 million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governors race in 2014 state data shows they dont vote because we dont ask and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking abrams said speaking on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers abrams a tax attorney and romance novelist who led democrats in the state legislature said her campaign has already reached out to more than 300000 voters with door knocks phone calls and text messages she hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen smaller cities  places like macon a predominately african american community and tiny dalton in the rural northern state national liberal activists are lining up endorsements money and manpower behind abrams who is seen as starting with an advantage in a democratic primary dominated by black voters democracy for america moveon political action and the working families party call her campaign a model of how to engage the nations increasingly diverse electorate politics is changing in america and abrams path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm said dan cantor national chairman of the working families

democratic governor as well as a bigname democratic strategist paul begala who worked for the governor who created the scholarship the georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away and those who want to drill deeper into the partys base to increase turnout said begala calling it an utterly false choice it is like a football team saying do you play offense or defense begala said you have to do both at a recent barbecue luncheon in athens evans pointed out that she outperformed clinton last

 long shadow the wake of the recent mass tragedy in las vegas has overtaken various current events including the bundy trial image mandalay bay hotel  resort by mark anderson the truth houndlas vegas although the ongoing bundy trial in the us district court in las vegas nevada has had its share of dramatic changes that s especially true latelya major twist is that internetradio personality pete santilli one of seven defendants in the trial that had been set to begin with jury selection on oct 10th before it was delayed again plead guilty on friday oct 6 and was released pending sentencing confirmed his attorney chris rasmussen of las vegasrancher cliven bundy held without trial for over 18 monthsin that highly anticipated trial with santilli now excluded due to his plea the federal government is trying elder rancher cliven bundy image left his sons ammon and ryan and militia leader ryan payne two other defendants o scott drexler and eric parker who are being retried for a third time from earlier proceedings will join the others in this second of three planned trialsanother development affecting the trial is concern that the oct 1st mass shooting at mandalay bay hotel might prevent the defendants from getting a fair shake according to ryan payne s attorney the vegas shooting has the potential to bias jurors and has asked that the trial be moved to nevada s second largest city reno located seven hours north of las vegasbut while moving the proceedings 450 miles away to reno s federal court appears unlikely as of this writing the las vegas federal court issued yet another delay in this complicated trial therefore the previously announced oct 10 date for jury selection for the second trial will be changed to on or around oct 30thand even that could be subject to change again given the already bumpy track record of this multipledefendant case in which the federal government has had a hard time making its allegations stickonly gregory burleson who s wheelchairbound and reportedly has developed blindness has been sentenced to 68 years no less he was convicted in the first trial that began in early february a codefendant in that trial todd engel is expected to be sentenced dec 22 though several other defendants have been cleared of numerous chargessantilli s journeysantilli who shot extended livestream video footage at the malheur national wildlife refuge building near burns oregon was held on remand for his role in that latter2015 early2016 affairthe controversial internet radio personality has had his share of critics both in and out of the court room some critics alleged that his some of the journalistic coverage shot in oregon enabled the government to more closely monitor the bundys and their supporters who had peacefully occupied the abandoned building to protest onerous federal land controls and the unlawful arrest of the hammonds local ranchers who had fallen foul of federal agents from the bureau of land management blm others however felt his coverage would have provided a helpful account of events had federal agents decided to take the building by force during the oregon hearings his defense attorney argued that much footage which he had broadcast on his youtube channel should be considered as protected speech under the first amendmenton the eve of last september s oregon trial santilli had all charges dismissed against himalthough later cleared of oregonrelated charges santilli remained in federal custody and was transferred to nevada to stand trial for his role in the famous spring 2014 standoff at bundy ranch in bunkerville nevada an event that saw cliven bundy his sons and other supporters gather to protest the policies of the blm and other agenciesfederal agents unsuccessfully attempted to confiscate cliven s cattle over alleged claims that he owed significant federal grazing fees and concerning a epa court order over a contested environmental mitigation policy concerned the relocation of the desert tortoise from the onset of the controversy cliven bundy has maintained the federal government lacks jurisdiction in that part of southern nevada and that the fees don t apply citing legal and historical matterssantilli released before the trialin nevada santilli pleaded guilty to count 2 a single felony count of obstruction of justice based on the government s claim that he used his own vehicle to impede the movement of an approaching blm convoy during the attempted cattle impoundment interestingly during that incident after the convoy stopped federal agents and their guard dogs were then confronted by members of the bundy family and their supporters santilli then filmed the altercation including federal agents tasering ammon bundy and posted it on youtube which went instantly viral garnering nearly 15 million views in just a few days the video was then syndicated on fox news and other national outlets many had credited santilli s original video entitled ranch riot as one of the key catalysts for the one thousand or so supporters and militia who then arrived at bundy ranch over the following 72 hours before the standoff on april 12 2014like all the other defendants he was initially charged with all 16 counts contained in the original federal complaint which carried a potential maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction for all or most of those countsinterestingly santilli s attorney mr rasmussen motioned in court and later told this writer that the government may consider the prison time that santilli has already served behind bars since jan 26 2016 as either sufficient punishment for that felony charge in a bestcase scenario or the court may at least consider giving him credit for that time served even if he s given a longer sentence at his expected sentencing hearing on jan 11 2018 at 8 amplea bargain detailsa reading of the plea agreement shows that the government reserves the right to impose a longer prison term possibly six years on santillialso rasmussen noted that residing judge gloria navarro is not bound by the agreement s recommendations meaning she could choose to alter them when she sentences santillimeanwhile two pending defense motions one to exclude oregonrelated evidence in the government s nevada case against santilli and another to challenge the government s claim that santilli could not excuse his nevada actions because of his journalistic background have become moot due to this plea bargain rasmussen addedthe agreement s terms may raise the question of whether the other defendants actions will be seen in a more negative light given the fact that santilli s guilty plea to the felonyobstruction charge requires under penalty of perjury that he accept the following governmentsourced narrative as true and correct the maximum penalty for conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer as this count against santilli is formally named under 18 usc 372 is six years imprisonment a fine of 250000 or bothbut in the shifting sands of these proceedings the understanding at this juncture is that santilli will owe neither a fine nor restitution nor will there be forfeiture of his assets provided he meets the terms of his release until he s sentenced although according to rasmussen santilli will not be electronically monitored despite speculation that he would be taggedreturning to internet radionotably santilli who is expected to return to his hometown of cincinnati ohio during the week starting monday oct 16 will reportedly be allowed at least for the time being to resume broadcasting his news contentasked if santilli would be able to comment on the bundy trial itself rasmussen replied in writing he can do whatever he wants as long as he s not committing crimes the first amendment allows him to comment on anything unless it is threatening or inciting violence furthermore attorney rasmussen said that santilli is under a selfimposed gag order not a governmentimposed one meaning he has chosen not to talk to reportersalso santilli will not testify against the other defendants and will not have to turn over his journalistic work products but only raw discovery information from court proceedings and the plea bargain stresses he must remain crimefree regarding federal state and local laws and among other things must avoid any known association with anyone who s breaking any law the plea agreement also restricts him from significant travel initially only between southern nevada and cincinnati ohionor can santilli possess a gun or any other item deemed by the government as a weapon just failing to show up for a hearing or some other procedural matter let alone larger infractions could result in this deal being dissolvedstay tuned for more updatesread more bundy ranch

sydney reuters  australia s high court on tuesday began a hearing on the validity of a government plan for a postal vote to legalize samesex marriage a challenge that risks destabilizing the ruling centerright coalition if the court rules against the plan prime minister malcolm turnbull could find himself presiding over a government fractured on the issue endangering his razorthin parliamentary majority of one with the noncompulsory vote a couple of weeks away its opponents have launched a legal challenge saying the vote needs the backing of parliament  which has twice rejected such a national ballot this case is about dignity and equality for lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex australians anna brown director of legal advocacy at the human rights law centre which leads the opposition to the vote told reporters in melbourne we re here because we all believe and want marriage equality this postal plebiscite has big question marks around its legal validity conservative lawmakers have threatened to resign if the ballot policy is not adhered to risking turnbull s parliamentary majority but he may not be able to stick to the postal vote policy as a group of liberal politicians has threatened to rebel and side with the opposition which would probably end his tenure as leader analysts say turnbull supports samesex marriage as do twothirds of australians but his party s conservative wing has threatened a revolt if he deviates from the policy of a national ballot frustrated by the political impasse a group of backbenchers this year said they were ready to vote with the opposition labor party to secure samesex marriage a plan only abandoned when turnbull offered a postal vote while a rejection of the legal challenge offers a political solution an increasingly vitriolic campaign forced turnbull to urge both sides to show mutual respect turnbull s plea has gone largely unheeded however opponents of samesex marriage last week launched a contentious campaign advertisement that the government immediately rejected as inaccurate since the postal vote is not a formal election it is not subject to the same rules on political advertisements and activists fear a surge in malicious campaigning in the runup our concern is around a sustained intense campaign it will make a question that should be a private matter between two people a matter for public discussion elaine pearson director of new yorkbased human rights watch who supports samesex marriage but opposes the national vote told reuters ,1,1

berlin reuters  airbus helicopters has warned pilots of its tiger military helicopters to be careful of rapid switches from auto pilot to manual mode during turbulence after initial indications that such a switch may have played a role in a fatal crash in mali the unit of european aerospace giant airbus said in a statement that the warning was aimed at increasing operators safety and should not be seen as an indication of the possible root cause of the crash during a un mission in july which killed both crew members according to a source who has seen the airbus helicopters bulletin that carried the warning the bulletin said an unexpected switch from automatic to manual flight mode may have played a role in the accident according to information currently available  the bulletin did not say whether the unexpected switch had happened automatically or been done manually german officials last week met to discuss the accident in the mali desert but decided to maintain existing flight restrictions on the aircraft after failing to reach a definite conclusion about the cause of the crash airbus said its safety guidance  sent to operators in germany australia france and spain  was meant to standardise all flight manuals and remind operators that crews must adjust their attention to environmental conditions while using the auto pilot during turbulence the guidance reiterated passages already in the flight manuals which instruct pilots not to intentionally enter areas with more than moderate turbulence and to avoid flying through areas of severe turbulence a german defence ministry report last month said the tiger that crashed in mali had been flying at 250 kilometres 155 miles per hour at a height of 550 metres 1800 feet when it suddenly sank its nose and entered a sharp dive the helicopter crashed 10 seconds later and burst into flames the report however said it was too early to speculate about the causes of the crash german officials continue to investigate the cause of the crash officials say it could take months to complete the probe at the time of the crash they said there were no signs the helicopter was downed by an attack germany s deployment of four tiger helicopters to mali earlier this year was controversial since the aircraft required extra maintenance given the strong heat and other environmental conditions in the african country although officials say the aircraft had been performing normally germany agreed to deploy the tiger helicopters and four nh90 transport helicopters after the dutch military said it could not continue the work in mali but germany s increased support was heavily debated in parliament and required a waiver from the german military allowing the helicopters to operate in higher temperatures germany currently has 26 tiger helicopters ,1,1

immediately after the police identified the suspect in the florida high school massacre as 19yearold nikolas cruz the media began to scour social media desperate to find any ties cruz may have had to the right  in the media s narrow minds you can t be a gun owner and not be tied to the republican party the republican party and the nra must be held accountable and they must be held accountable at all costs even at the cost of being accurate or truthful when the media couldn t find any facts to report they immediately began to scour social media for hints what they got was a bunch of social media trolls who thought it would be funny to lead the mainstream media on with lies about the shooter the mainstream media and the anti defamation league who ironically claims to defend people who are victims of discrimination yet works overtime to demonize anyone whose views are to the right of theirs had to settle for fake ties to the massacre suspect and white supremacist group in tallahassee floridaunfortunately both the media and the anti defamation league s stories quickly fell apart when they were outed for not having done their homework to properly vet the comments made on an open chat social media platform called 4chanon thursday afternoon the antidefamation league reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with nikolas cruz who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people including many highschool students at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland floridafrom the anti defamation league s websitea spokesperson for the white supremacist group republic of florida rof claimed to the antidefamation league on thursday february 15 that nikolas cruz the man charged with the previous day s deadly shooting spree at a parkland florida high school was associated with his groupupdate on thursday afternoon following news reports of the alleged association between cruz and the republic of florida a member of an alt right discussion forum wrote that all of the claims were false and were part of an elaborate attempt to troll a network news reporter and other media outlets at a press conference thursday afternoon the broward county sheriff said a connection was not confirmed at this time but that law enforcement was still investigatingcruz 19 a former student at marjory stoneman douglas high school allegedly entered the school wednesday february 14 with an ar15 and opened fire killing at least 17 people and injuring 14 more cruz left the scene but was later captured by police and has been charged with premeditated murderafter selfdescribed rof members claimed on the discussion forum 4chan that cruz had also been a member the antidefamation league spoke with an rof member who identified himself as jordan jerebjereb based in tallahassee is believed to be the leader of rof in 2016 he was arrested on charges of threatening a staffer in the office of florida governor rick scott because he was allegedly angry at the staffer s sonjereb said that cruz was associated with rof having been brought up by another member jereb also claimed that cruz had participated in one or more rof training exercises in the tallahassee area carpooling with other rof members from south floridarof has members in north and south florida the alt right white supremacist group borrows paramilitary concepts from the antigovernment extremist militia movement not itself a white supremacist movement rof describes itself as a white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics and seeks to create a white ethnostate in florida most rof members are young and the group itself is only a few years oldjereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shootingif cruz s role is confirmed the parkland school shooting would be the second school shooting by a white supremacist in the past two months in december 2017 another young white supremacist william atchison engaged in a shooting spree at a high school in northwest new mexico killing two students before shooting himselfwhat we know about rof the republic of florida a spokesperson for the white supremacist group republic of florida rof told the antidefamation league on thursday february 15 that nikolas cruz   was associated with his group the adl reported the adl quoted a man named jordan jereb who runs the small group which is based in tallahassee jereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shooting the adl wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by abc news and the associated press and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets even the daily stormer a neonazi website picked up the claimsome outlets reported they had their own conversations with jereb or classmates of cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of cruz with rofbut a few hours later after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking cruz to rof jereb said his identification of cruz was a misunderstanding and that he too had been the subject of a prank on online forums and twitter trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed politico reports all of our evidence seems to point to the adl getting this wrong said joan donovan a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for data  society a think tank in new york citythe adl subsequently revised its report as did many news outlets adl shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events an adl spokesperson said in a statement on friday confirmation of whether cruz was part of rof is now in the hands of law enforcement and that s what the broward sheriff s team is looking into the adl traced its original tip to posts on 4chan where researchers found selfdescribed rof members claiming that cruz was a brotherinarms but many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researcherson wednesday an anonymous 4chan user posted about receiving a message on instagram from an abc news reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew cruz prime trolling opportunity another user replied you have to take advantage of this a third chimed inhe asked for proof of the reporter s identity according to posted screenshots from their correspondence the reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an abc identification badgesome on the 4chan thread joked about sending back obscene photos but others gave concrete tips for tricking the reporter keep talking to her so she gains your trust  keep this going be realistic say you have known him for years you met him on a liberal facebook page years ago and you have kept in touch  say you are scared to tell her in case you get blamed it will get her excited you know something big this particular 4chan user seems to have sent the reporter a racist cartoon and was quickly blocked many on the forum ripped into him for missing a a golden opportunity ,0,0

new york reuters  democrat doug jones won a bitter fight for a us senate seat in deeply conservative alabama on tuesday dealing a political blow to president donald trump in a race marked by sexual misconduct accusations against republican candidate roy moore key points the stunning upset makes jones the first democrat elected to the us senate from alabama in a quartercentury and will trim the republicans already narrow senate majority to 5149 opening the door for democrats to possibly retake the chamber in next years congressional elections peter cardillo chief market economist at first standard financial in new york if anything it prompts congress to get the tax bill signed before year end and they have another week if they dont they do have a problem from that perspective yesterdays defeat is good news in terms of tax legislation theyre not going to risk tax reform because of the election while its a defeat its actually a positive if the president doesnt sign legislation by year end we have a major problem that would just speed up the process of a correction would it affect the economy reverse the economic growth not in 2018 perhaps in 2019 it was a defeat for the republican party and mr trump but it also motivates the republicans to get their act together and get a bill signed keith lerner chief market strategist suntrust advisory services in atlanta ga tax reform is still likely to go through what happened overnight may present an obstacle to the gop agenda in 2018 but thats arguably less important than tax reform perhaps there will be some obstacles to infrastructure entitlement reform but from a market perspective those werent highprobability anyway the high probability is tax gets through the republicans have tried to fasttrack it before jones gets seated so its unlikely his victory will change that well have a shortterm setback if the tax bill doesnt pass and it may cap the upside of the market since companies wont be getting an earnings boost but if theres a pullback i think it will be in the 5 to 10 percent range as opposed to a bear market its still early but there looks certainly to be big changes in the midterm with the makeup of the house and senate as long as the economy is on sound footing gridlock in washington is not necessarily a bad thing its not necessarily preferable but with the majority so slim as it is its more of a question does the economy chug along if the economy continues to move forward its less important gennadiy goldberg interest rates strategist td securities new york we think one of the possible biggest impact is on the deficit with the jones win it makes it more difficult to pass the taxcut bill this puts pressure on the republicans to pass tax cuts before yearend the question is can they do it are we going to see special provisions or deals to get it done i think its a get it done mentality if not it does bleed into early 2018 it lowers the odds of getting anything done in 2018 l thomas block fundstrat global advisors washington policy strategy from research note bottom line is that the alabama senate race doesnt change the basic washington dc headlines first that tax bill should pass by christmas and that there are tough negotiations ahead to solve the budget issues and avoid a government shutdown marc chandler global head of currency strategy brown brothers harriman from research note the dollar did slip to the low for the week against the yen when it became clear that the republicans were going to lose the senate seat in alabama this reduced the republican majority to one in the senate owing the fissures in the party this is putting at risk other parts of trumps agenda which treasury secretary mnuchin acknowledged earlier this week is necessary to achieve the kind of growth levels that the tax bill assumes us stock futures and the dollar dipped on wednesday although equities turned around by the open and the sp 500 index was last up 02 percent ,1,1

families evacuated from that enclave as part of a surrender deal were escorted by the syrian army and hezbollah to east syria but have been stopped by a usled coalition from reaching deir alzor ten of

dnc chairman tom perez decided to create his own reality during a speech on tuesday this is such a democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them it s really pitiful that after so many months that all the democrats have is this lie the electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters would you want california and new york deciding our elections that s what would happen without the electoral college we bet that perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it

facebookjssdkdnc chair tom perez incorrectly claims the electoral college is not a creation of the constitution posted by fox  friends on friday october 27 2017 the electoral college is not a creation of the constitution perez said during a lecture at indiana university law school it doesn t have to be there the electoral college a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the founding fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states is clearly laid out in article ii of the constitution each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress perez has previously stated that president donald trump didn t win last november s election because hillary clinton won the popular votefollowing his comment perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a national popular vote compact in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote there s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says we will allocate our vote our electoral votes to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same perez said i m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was maryland the main supporters of the plan put forward by perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the constitution not an argument that the system doesn t existthe comment from perez came during a lecture honoring former indiana democratic sen birch bayh who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine via wfbour previous report on the electoral collegeplease share this with the clueless left if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote small and rural states would become irrelevant and campaigns would spend their time in large populous districts the electoral college remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the constitution empowered it to select presidents though occasionally maligned this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the american peoplethe founding fathers created the electoral college after much debate and compromise but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections 1824 1876 1888 and 2000some see the electoral college as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the united states others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large onesevery four years around election time there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct national popular votethe founders collegeas one of the heritage foundations legal experts hans von spakovsky noted in a paper on the electoral college in creating the basic architecture of the american government the founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule some elements of the electoral college such as the indirect vote through intermediaries were hotly debated at the 1787 constitutional convention it was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal traitor or similar kind of heinous person the founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the american system but they feared a kind of pure unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the pastthe product of the founders compromise has been well balanced and enduring and we would be wise to leave it intactalexander hamilton defended the electoral college in federalist 68 he argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president but it was also desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability and that an intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes as students of ancient history the founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people the electoral college was a compromise neither fully democratic nor aristocraticthe constitution stateseach state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congressin addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule the founding fathers attempted to create a federalist system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities america s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states not just the american people as an undifferentiated massthe total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the district of columbia included after the passage of the 23rd amendment adds up to 538 the winner must receive a majority or 270 of these votes to become presidentthe system empowers states especially smaller ones because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers farmers in iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in new york a more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into accountthe states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors in the early days of the republic most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors rather than the people but over time the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead every state has opted for popular election at least since the civil warcalls to abolishmodern opponents of the electoral college argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution criticizing both the intermediary electors and the statebystate system of votingcalls to fundamentally change the electoral college reached a peak after republican george w bush defeated democrat al gore in the tightly contested 2000 election gore narrowly won the national popular vote and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the supreme court stepping in was unfairone organization national popular vote has worked toward eliminating the electoral college through an amendment to the constitution or a state compact national popular vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in swing states rather than campaigning for votes across the entire countrythis plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support but heritage s von spakovsky has called it bad policy based on mistaken assumptions swing states he wrote can change from election to election and many states that are today considered to be reliably blue or red in the presidential race were recently unpredictable many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national votebut this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers swing states change over time and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swingstate unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political mapadditionally if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote small and rural states would become irrelevant and campaigns would spend their time in large populous

on tuesday democratic senator dianne feinstein of california blasted president trump for saying he would move the us embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem feinstein claimed it would be a terrible decision even though she previously voted for the embassy to be moved the hypocrisy of the left doesn t stop there today president donald trump announced that america formally recognizes jerusalem as israel s capital city changing decades of us policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve not derail aspirations for regional peacethe critics of donald trump attacked his decision meanwhile the truth is that for decades some of the most beloved democrats have used the promise of recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel as a way to get votesin 1999 while campaigning for new york s us senate seat first lady hillary rodham clinton said in a letter that she considered jerusalem to be the eternal and indivisible capital of israel and will be an active advocate if elected to new york s senate seat to move the us embassy to jerusalemin a letter that became public thursday mrs clinton wrote if i am chosen by new yorkers to be their senator or in whatever position i find myself in the years to come you can be sure that i will be an active committed advocate for a strong and secure israel able to live in peace with its neighbors with the united states embassy located in its capital jerusalem hillary s not the only one to promise that if elected they would move heaven and earth to make jerusalem the rightful capital of israel as it turns out bill clinton george w bush and barack obama twice also made the same promise the only problem is none of them had the courage to do itwatchwhen president realdonaldtrump announced that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel he fulfilled another campaign promise in addition to those that go back 25 years  pictwittercomp7m2dex2qt dan scavino jr danscavino december 7 2017here s why our courageous president donald trump was right to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israelmatthew continetti of the washington free beacon wrote the best article on trump s bold decision to move the us embassy to jerusalem that we have seen to datenot only is president trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and begin the process of moving the us embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency it is one of the boldest moves any us president has made since the beginning of the oslo peace process in 1993 that process collapsed at camp david in 2000 when yasir arafat rejected president clinton s offer of a palestinian state and the process has been moribund ever since despite multiple attempts to restart itthat is why the warnings from trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow there is no peace process to wreck the conflict is frozen and the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in us or israeli policy but in palestinian autocracy corruption and incitement have the former obama administration officials decrying trump s announcement read a newspaper lately from listening to them you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the middle east but for trump in fact the region is engulfed in war terrorism poverty and despotism israel faces threats in the north and south its sworn enemy iran is growing in influence and reach and the delegitimization of the jewish state proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses i forget how the obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world maybe someone will remind meone of the reasons the middle east persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been for decades a playground of magical thinking whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the ayatollah khamenei is a goodfaith partner whether it is imagining that assad will go just because we tell him to or that isis is akin to a terrorist jv team liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the middle east that is much more flattering than the actuality a similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over jerusalem every israeli knows jerusalem was is and will remain his capital every recent president has agreed with him and the us consensus has been bipartisan the last four democratic platforms have said the obvious that jerusalem is israel s capital the senate voted 900 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote was it all virtuesignaling a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of us diplomacyit is a sign of the disingenuousness of american foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning president trump has no background in or admiration for the routines manners and norms of the us foreign service especially that part of it which specializes in the israelipalestinian conflict this has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid jerusalem is israel s capital full stop his transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition in march 2016 at the aipac policy conference he pledged that we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people jerusalem his remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the proisrael communityi wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of us law as disruptive have they not paid attention to this man donald trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the us capital for decades in this sense his jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm he is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion what trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one by keeping his campaign promise today he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the

robert parry consortium newsmake no mistake about it the united states has entered an era of a new mccarthyism that blames nearly every political problem on russia and has begun targeting american citizens who don t go along with this new cold war propagandaa difference however from the mccarthyism of the 1950s is that this new mccarthyism has enlisted democrats liberals and even progressives in the cause because of their disgust with president trump the 1950s version was driven by republicans and the right with much of the left on the receiving end maligned by the likes of sen joe mccarthy as unamerican and as communism s fellow travelers the real winners in this new mccarthyism appear to be the neoconservatives who have leveraged the democraticliberal hatred of trump to draw much of the left into the political hysteria that sees the controversy over alleged russian political meddling as an opportunity to get trump already the neocons and their allies have exploited the antirussian frenzy to extract tens of millions of dollars more from the taxpayers for programs to combat russian propaganda ie funding of nongovernmental organizations and scholars who target dissident americans for challenging the justifications for this new cold warthe washington post which for years has served as the flagship for neocon propaganda is again charting the new course for america much as it did in rallying us public backing for the 2003 invasion of iraq and in building sympathy for abortive regime change projects aimed at syria and iran the post has begun blaming almost every unpleasant development in the world on russia russia russiafor instance a post editorial on tuesday shifted the blame for the anemic victory of german chancellor angela merkel and the surprising strength of the farright alternative for germany afd from merkel s austerity policies which have caused hardship for much of the working class or from her open door for mideast refugees which has destabilized some workingclass neighborhoods to you guessed it russiathe evidence as usual is vague and selfinterested but sure to be swallowed by many democrats and liberals who hate russia because they blame it for trump and by lots of republicans and conservatives who have a residual hatred for russia left over from the old cold warthe post cited the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab which has been pushing much of the hysteria about alleged russian activities on the internet the atlantic council essentially is nato s think tank and is financed with money from the us government gulf oil states military contractors global financial institutions and many other sources which stand to gain directly or indirectly from the expanding us military budget and nato interventionsblaming russiain this new cold war the russians get blamed for not only disrupting some neocon regime change projects such as the proxy war in syria but also political developments in the west such as donald trump s election and afd s rise in germanythe atlantic council s digital lab claimed according to the post editorial that in the final hours of the german campaign online supporters of the afd began warning their base of possible election fraud and the online alarms were driven by anonymous troll accounts and boosted by a russianlanguage botnet of course the post evinces no evidence tying any of this to the russian government or to president vladimir putin it is the nature of mccarthyism that actual evidence is not required just heavy breathing and dark suspicions for those of us who operate web sites trolls some volunteers and some professionals have become a common annoyance and they represent many political outlooks not just russianplus it is standard procedure these days for campaigns to issue lastminute alarms to their supporters about possible election fraud to raise doubts about the results should the outcome be disappointingthe us government has engaged in precisely this strategy around the world having prous parties not only complain about election fraud but to take to the streets in violent protests to impugn the legitimacy of election outcomes that us strategy has been applied to places such as ukraine the orange revolution in 2004 iran the green revolution in 2009 russia the snow revolution in 2011 and many other locationspreelection alerts also have become a feature in us elections even in 2016 when both donald trump and hillary clinton raised questions about the legitimacy of the balloting albeit for different reasonsyet instead of seeing the afd maneuver as a typical ploy by a relatively minor party and the german election outcome as an understandable reflection of voter discontent and weariness over merkel s three terms as chancellor the atlantic council and the post see russians under every bed and particularly putinloving to hate putinin the world of neocon propaganda putin has become the great b te noire since he has frustrated a variety of neocon schemes he helped head off a major us military strike against syria in 2013 he aided president obama in achieving the iran nuclear agreement in 201415 putin opposed and to a degree frustrated the neoconsupported coup in ukraine in 2014 and he ultimately supplied the air power that defeated neoconbacked rebel forces in syria in 201517so the post and the neocons want putin gone and they have used gauzy allegations about russian meddling in the us and other elections as the new propaganda theme to justify destabilizing russia with economic sanctions and if possible engineering another regime change project in moscownone of this is even secret carl gershman the neocon president of the usgovernmentfunded national endowment for democracy publicly proclaimed the goal of ousting putin in an oped in the washington post writing the united states has the power to contain and defeat this danger the issue is whether we can summon the will to do so but the way neocon propaganda works is that the us and its allies are always the victims of some nefarious enemy who must be thwarted to protect all that is good in the world in other words even as ned and other usfunded operations take aim at putin and russia russia and putin must be transformed into the aggressors mr putin would like nothing better than to generate doubts fog cracks and uncertainty around the german pillar of europe the post editorial said he relishes infiltrating chaos and mischief into open societies in this case supporting the farright afd is extraordinarily cynical given how many millions of russians died to defeat the fascists seven decades ago not to belabor the point but there is no credible evidence that putin did any of this there is a claim by the virulently antirussian atlantic council that some anonymous troll accounts promoted some afd complaint about possible voter fraud and that it was picked up by a russianlanguage botnet even if that is true and the atlantic council is far from an objective source where is the link to putinnot everything that happens in russia a nation of 144 million people is ordered by putin but the post would have you believe that it is it is the centerpiece of this neocon conspiracy theorysilencing dissentsimilarly any american who questions this propaganda immediately is dismissed as a kremlin stooge or a russian propagandist another ugly campaign spearheaded by the post and the neocons again no evidence is required just some analysis that what you re saying somehow parallels something putin has saidon tuesday in what amounted to a companion piece for the editorial a post article again pushed the unproven suspicions about russian operatives buying 100000 in facebook ads from 2015 into 2017 to supposedly influence us politics once again no evidence requiredin the article the post also reminds its readers that moscow has a history of focusing on social inequities in the us which gets us back to the comparisons between the old mccarthyism and the newyes it s true that the soviet union denounced america s racial segregation and cited that ugly feature of us society in expressing solidarity with the american civil rights movement and national liberation struggles in africa it s also true that american communists collaborated with the domestic civil rights movement to promote racial integrationthat was a key reason why j edgar hoover s fbi targeted martin luther king jr and other africanamerican leaders because of their association with known or suspected communists similarly the reagan administration resisted support for nelson mandela because his african national congress accepted communist support in its battle against south africa s apartheid whitesupremacist regimeinterestingly one of the arguments from liberal national democrats in opposing segregation in the 1960s was that the repression of american blacks undercut us diplomatic efforts to develop allies in africa in other words soviet and communist criticism of america s segregation actually helped bring about the demise of that offensive systemyet king s association with alleged communists remained a talking point of diehard segregationists even after his assassination when they opposed creating a national holiday in his honor in the 1980sthese parallels between the old mccarthyism and the new mccarthyism are implicitly acknowledged in the post s news article on tuesday which cites putin s criticism of police killings of unarmed american blacks as evidence that he is meddling in us politics since taking office putin has on occasion sought to spotlight racial tensions in the united states as a means of shaping perceptions of american society the article states putin injected himself in 2014 into the race debate after protests broke out in ferguson mo over the fatal shooting of michael brown an african american by a white police officer do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy in the united states putin told cbs s 60 minutes program if everything was perfect there wouldn t be the problem of ferguson there would be no abuse by the police but our task is to see all these problems and respond properly the post s speculative point seems to be that putin s response included having russian operatives buy some ads on facebook to exploit these racial tensions but there is no evidence to support that conspiracy theoryhowever as this antirussia hysteria spreads we may soon see americans who also protest the police killing of unarmed black men denounced as putin s fellowtravelers much as king and other civil rights leaders were smeared as communist dupes ignoring realityso instead of democrats and chancellor merkel looking in the mirror and seeing the real reasons why many white workingclass voters are turning toward populist and extremist alternatives they can simply blame putin and continue a crackdown on internetbased dissent as the work of russian operatives already under the guise of combating russian propaganda and fake news google facebook and other tech giants have begun introducing algorithms to hunt down and marginalize news that challenges official us government narratives on hotbutton issues such as ukraine and syria again no evidence is required just the fact that putin may have said something similaras democrats liberals and even some progressives join in this russiagate hysteria driven by their hatred of donald trump and his supposedly fascistic tendencies they might want to consider whom they ve climbed into bed with and what these neocons have in mind for the futurearguably if fascism or totalitarianism comes to the united states it is more likely to arrive in the guise of protecting democracy from russia or another foreign adversary than from a realitytv clown like donald trumpthe new mccarthyism with its orwellianstyle algorithms might seem like a clever way to neutralize or maybe even help oust trump but long after trump is gone a structure for letting the neocons and the mainstream media monopolize american political debate might be a far greater threat to

likely to hear about in 1980 after a sixhour suicidal standoff with police a contract killer linked to organized crime named charles harrelson admitted to killing us district judge john h wood and in the process while apparently high on cocaine also claimed to have been involved in the assassination of president john f kennedythe father of hollywood star woody harrelson was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named sam degelia jr in 1968 and in 1981 charles received two life sentences for the murder of john woodthroughout 1981 more questions materialized regarding the assassination of judge wood in a upi article defense lawyers maintained charles harrelson was framed by police and the informant charles an exfelon said a friend hampton robinson iii who failed to show up to testify had driven the car he suggested someone possibly federal agents had planted the guns so he could be arrested he denied telling department of public safety agent pagel he carried a gun three tramps

harrelsonkennedy connection the 1989 book crossfire comes to mindcrossfire written by the recently deceased wellknown researcher jim marrs was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful oliver stone film jfk below is a passage from crossfire as it relates to the apparent harrelsonkennedy link aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire harrelson the father of actor woody harrelson had a long history of involvement with dallas underworld characters linked directly to jack ruby continuing the crossfire also stated the late fort worth graphics expert jack white who testified before the house select committee on assassinations already had noticed the resemblance of harrelson to the youngest tramp in a 1981 interview with chuck cook harrelson claimed to have the biggest story the reporter would ever have when questioned about kennedy s death additionally jo ann harrelson noted the similarities between the tramp photos and her husband all this coupled with the fact diane lou oswald the mother of woody harrelson who had also been married to charles harrelson in midland texas made for a strange background concerning the jfk sagain a kdfwtv interview in 1982 below charles harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing kennedy but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the us government s involvement in the death of kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in americathe interview is a startling revelation adding to the enigmatic jfk mystery and in the process provides another strange backdrop to a captivating case  21st century wire says today president donald trump announced he plans to release the tens of thousands of classified documents on the assassination of president john f kennedy held at the national archives and records administration the president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise a white house official told reuters subject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened trump tweeted on saturdaysubject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 21 2017days before trump s announcement the washington post claim that their national security council source told deep state media oracle that federal government agencies have warned the president not to release some of the documents for fear they could somehow comprise national security  although this rationale is hard to justify as the event took place nearly 55 years ago unless of course some legacy parties still in power today were implicated in the remaining documentsit s difficult to know if trump is referring to all of the remaining cia and fbi documents or just some of them or whether or not these documents will be redacted presumably to protect any important names involved in the jfk murder or possible coverup however trump appears to have left open the possibility that if government agencies feel the documents should not to released then he would heed their advice trump added that his decision was subject to the receipt of further information according to phil shenon a professional researcher and author on the warren commission it s great news that the president is focused on this and that he s trying to demonstrate transparency but the question remains whether he will open the library in full every word in every document as the law requires shenon said and my understanding is that he won t without infuriating people at the cia and elsewhere who are determined to keep at least some of the information secret especially in documents created in the 1990s the scheduled date of the release is meant to be on october 26 2017stay tuned

in september 2016 stephen henderson the editorial editor of the detroit free press used the power of his pen to unjustly attack kid rock after liberals feared rock might actually be serious about running as a republican contender against the donothing democrat senator debbie stabenow as a michigan resident i can say with a great level of confidence that besides mike illitch the now deceased owner of the red wings and detroit tigers kid rock has done more for the city of detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state when the illitch s asked detroit legend and philanthropist kid rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated little caesar s arena no one could have dreamed that the detroit free press stephen henderson would have used his position to push a lie that kid rock the single father of a black son and naacp award recipient is a racist here s what henderson had to say about kid rock the man who has done so much for the city of detroitthis is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music who used to wrap his brand in the confederate flag a symbol inextricably linked to racism no matter what its defenders say and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of african americans pushing back against american inequality just last week he trashed colin kaepernick the former san francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent kneeling protest during the prefootball game singing of the national anthem having kid rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to detroiters nothing less and the ilitches who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it should be the last to embrace that kind of signalinghere is how kid rock responded on his facebook pagepeople pay no attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create and by the way fuck the extreme left and the extreme rightthey are trying to use the old confederate flag bs etc to stir the pot when we all know none of this would be going on if i were not thinking of running for office pretty funny how scared i have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people  me racist who do not agree or cower to them no one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at lca back in january my track record in detroit and michigan speaks for itself and i would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine i am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of detroit so suck on that tooi am the bona fide king of detroit love and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our cityi am however very disappointed that none of the people businesses or charities i have so diligently supported in detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and the detroit free press so for the unforeseen future i will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones i have supported in the past i would however employ that nan go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people i love idiots  has al sharpton even paid his back taxes yettoday the raceobsessed stephen henderson got some very bad news ap the detroit free press fired stephen henderson its managing director of opinion and commentary after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues the newspaper announced fridayfree press editor and vice president peter

company values and standards henderson said in a statement to the detroit news and crain s detroit business that he is stunned i dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades all of it performing at the highest level henderson said i may have more to say on this later but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of detroit stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for detroit bhatia said he added there were no accusations of sexual assault but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at free press employees ran counter to company policiesless than 2 months ago henderson appeared on meet the press and called america a racist nation with a racist historyrich lowry of the national review appeared with stephen henderson on meet the press to discuss colin kaepernick and other nfl players who disrespect the flag as a way to support black lives matter henderson argued some of the words in the national anthem are racist henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the american flag because he thinks america is a country whose history is racist henderson told the panel i think this is a country whose history is racist whose history is steeped in white supremacy and the anthem reflects that in its very words inaudible  lowry responded to henderson by saying

washington reuters  president donald trumps campaign to shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy so far has made a small dent in the federal workforce and that largely because of a decline in civilian defense jobs days after his jan 20 inauguration trump ordered a hiring freeze later replaced with an order for federal agencies to cut staff immediately and in march he proposed a 2018 budget that sought to shift 54 billion to the military from other departments however federal civilian jobs declined around 6000 in the first nine months of this year or just 03 percent of 21 million such jobs tracked by the office of personnel management according to reuters calculations based on the latest opm data published in late october the white house office of management and budget declined to comment on the overall drop in federal employment or the mix of job gains and losses across agencies the office issued in april the order for agencies to start nearterm staffing cuts and to submit plans for longerterm reductions by september trump has not detailed how much fat he aims to cut but spoke of billions and billions of dollars of government waste and his aim to shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy while preparing his budget proposals in march independent watchdogs agree the federal government could be made more efficient with congresss government accountability office estimating in april that overlap and duplication lead to tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary spending before trump democrats barack obama and bill clinton and republican george w bush have all spearheaded various efforts to streamline government bureaucracy david lewis a political science professor at vanderbilt university said this years numbers showed that trumps executive orders had limited power to reshape the federal bureaucracy ultimately the congress controlled the budgets and had the biggest sway over agencies staffing said lewis whose research has largely focused on executive branch politics and public administration the white house has said agencies longerterm workforce reduction plans will serve to develop trumps 2019 budget proposal the overall decline in federal staffing this year is largely due to a roughly 9500 drop at the department of defense to about 731000 a 13 percent decline even though trumps budget proposal envisaged small increases between 2016 and 2018 in employment measured by hours worked pentagon spokesman dave eastburn said hiring was slow during the white houseordered freeze but exemptions allowed recruitment for missioncritical positions and military readiness was never affected he described the decrease in staffing this year as well within historical norms in fact the number of activeduty service personnel which was exempt from the hiring freeze grew by about 7000 in the 12 months through september according to defense department data still cuts in the civilian staff could push more work onto relatively expensive contractors and military officers potentially raising costs over time said scott amey general counsel at the project on government oversight a nonpartisan watchdog group if were just cutting jobs to cut jobs then mistakes are likely to be made amey said after reviewing reuters calculations of opm data mallory barg bulman a researcher at the partnership for public service a nonpartisan nonprofit said targeting the number of jobs in general was not the best way of improving how the bureaucracy works a hiring freeze is not the answer to making the government more effective said barg bulman instead agencies should invest more in training to boost productivity she said the opm figures which exclude the postal service and some smaller independent agencies showed the declines were in part offset by staffing gains  totaling about 9000  at the homeland security and veterans affairs departments much of the gains were in divisions that control immigration and in medical care for former soldiers areas trump has identified as priorities the department of veterans affairs did not respond to a request for comment a spokeswoman at the department of homeland security said staffing increases owed to revised recruitment strategies as well as temporary hiring for hurricane relief efforts some staffing ups and downs at agencies are part of longstanding budget issues or seasonal factors the treasury department lost staff largely due to budget cuts ordered by congress in past years for its tax collection service while the departments of interior and agriculture saw increases due to seasonal hiring this version of the story has been refiled to clarify description of the partnership for public service in paragraph 15 ,1,1
