Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments,seattlewashington reuters  president donald trump called on the us postal service on friday to charge much more to ship packages for amazon amzno picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more trump wrote on twitter the presidents tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season the us postal service which runs at a big loss is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses according to its website package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of firstclass letters the president does not determine postal rates they are set by the postal regulatory commission an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties that panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in november amazon was founded by jeff bezos who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world according to bloomberg news bezos also owns the washington post a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media in tweets over the past year trump has said the amazon washington post fabricated stories he has said amazon does not pay sales tax which is not true and so hurts other retailers part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january daniel ives a research analyst at gbh insights said trumps comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant however he said he was not concerned for amazon we do not see any price hikes in the future however that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and it is building out its distribution system aggressively he said amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service including testing drones for deliveries in 2015 the company spent 115 billion on shipping 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year amazon shares were down 086 percent to 117590 by early afternoon overall us stock prices were down slightly on friday satish jindel president of shipmatrix inc which analyzes shipping data disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc upsn and fedex corp fdxn the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services he said the postal service delivers about 62 percent of amazon packages for about 35 to 4 million a day during the current peak yearend holiday shipping season jindel said the seattlebased company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys from post offices to customers doorsteps amazons no 2 carrier is ups at 21 percent and fedex is third with 8 percent or so according to jindel trumps comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of ecommerce which has flooded the mail with small packagesprivate companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business steve gaut a spokesman for ups noted that the company values its productive relationship with the postal service but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal services methods for covering costs representatives for amazon the white house the us postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trumps tweet according to its annual report the postal service lost 274 billion this year and its deficit has ballooned to 6186 billion while the postal services revenue for first class mail marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to 195 billion in the fiscal year ended sept 30 2017 but it also lost about 2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april 2016 according to a government accountability office report in february the service is facing growing personnel expenses particularly 734 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs by law the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service but the postal service allocates only 55 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue ,politicsNews,29-Dec-17,1

New York governor questions the constitutionality of federal tax overhaul,new yorkwashington reuters  the new us tax code targets hightax states and may be unconstitutional new york governor andrew cuomo said on thursday saying that the bill may violate new york residents rights to due process and equal protection the sweeping republican tax bill signed into law by us president donald trump on friday introduces a cap of 10000 on deductions of state and local income and property taxes known as salt the tax overhaul was the partys first major legislative victory since trump took office in january the salt provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes high property values and high taxes like new york new jersey and california those states are generally democratic leaning im not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and thats something were looking at now cuomo said in an interview with cnn in an interview with cnbc cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional politics does not trump the law cuomo said on cnbc you have the constitution you have the law you have due process you have equal protection you cant use politics just because the majority controls to override the law the fifth amendment of the constitution better known for its protection against selfincrimination also protects individuals from seizure of life liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the supreme court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law cuomo and california governor jerry brown both democrats have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states rights under the us constitutions 10th amendment tax attorneys said cuomos legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for democrats in the past  known as blue states the de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from cuomos perspective the state of new york said joseph callahan an attorney with the law firm mackay caswell  callahan in new york but some tax experts noted the us supreme court has interpreted the 16th amendment to give congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit in a frequently cited 1934 decision the supreme court called tax deductions a legislative grace rather than a vested right i dont understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here david gamage a professor of tax law at indiana universitys maurer school of law told reuters last week speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill cuomo also said on thursday that new york is proposing a restructuring of its tax code he provided no details a group of 13 law professors on dec 18 published a paper suggesting ways that hightax states could minimize the effects of the salt deduction cap their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employerside payroll taxes since the federal tax bills cap on salt deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses states also could raise taxes on passthrough entities which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income on friday cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full prepayment on their property tax bill before jan 1 allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for 2017 before the cap kicks in prompting a wave of residents to pay early however the us internal revenue service on wednesday advised homeowners that the prepayment of 2018 property taxes may not be deductible ,politicsNews,28-Dec-17,1

Exclusive: U.S. memo weakens guidelines for protecting immigrant children in court,new york reuters  the us justice department has issued new guidelines for immigration judges that remove some instructions for how to protect unaccompanied juveniles appearing in their courtrooms a dec 20 memo issued by the executive office for immigration review eoir replaces 2007 guidelines spelling out policies and procedures judges should follow in dealing with children who crossed the border illegally alone and face possible deportation the new memo removes suggestions contained in the 2007 memo for how to conduct childsensitive questioning and adds reminders to judges to maintain impartiality even though juvenile cases may present sympathetic allegations the new document also changes the word child to unmarried individual under the age of 18 in many instances link to comparison tmsnrtrs2blt0vk may 2007 document tmsnrtrs2bbr8wj december 2017 document tmsnrtrs2c2swcs an eoir official said the new memo contained clarifications and updates to 10yearold guidance in order to be consistent with the laws as theyve been passed by congress the new memo was posted on the justice department website but has not been previously reported immigration advocates said they worry the new guidelines could make court appearances for children more difficult and a spokeswoman for the union representing immigration judges said judges are concerned about the tone of the memo president donald trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key policy goal of his administration and has focused particularly on trying to curb the illegal entry of children the administration says it wants to prevent vulnerable juveniles from making perilous journeys to the united states and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants one changed section of the memo focuses on how to make children comfortable in the court in advance of hearings the old guidance says they should be permitted to explore courtrooms and allowed to sit in all locations including especially the judges bench and the witness stand the new guidance says such explorations should take place only to the extent that resources and time permit and specifically puts the judges bench off limits the new memo also warns judges to be skeptical since an unaccompanied minor generally receives more favorable treatment under the law than other categories of illegal aliens which creates an incentive to misrepresent accompaniment status or age in order to attempt to qualify for the benefits it also says to be on the lookout for fraud and abuse language that was not in the previous memo immigration judges are appointed by the us attorney general and courts are part of the department of justice not an independent branch the only sitting immigration judges routinely allowed to speak to the media are representatives of their union the national association of immigration judges dana marks a sitting judge and spokeswoman for the union said the overall tone of the memo is very distressing and concerning to immigration judges there is a feeling that the immigration courts are just being demoted into immigration enforcement offices rather than neutral arbiters marks said there has been a relentless beating of the drum toward enforcement rather than due process former immigration judge andrew arthur who now works at the center for immigration studies which promotes lower levels of immigration overall said the new guidelines were needed in their previous form he said so much emphasis was placed on the potential inability of the alien to understand the proceedings  that it almost put the judge into the position of being an advocate the courts have had to handle a surge in cases for unaccompanied minors mostly from central america after their numbers skyrocketed in 2014 as violence in the region caused residents to flee north while illegal crossings initially fell after trump took office us customs and border protection said that since may each month has seen an increase in children being apprehended either alone or with family members attorney general jeff sessions said in a speech in boston in september that the special accommodations for unaccompanied minors had been exploited by gang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep clothing echoing some of these concerns the new memo notes in a preamble that not all child cases involve innocents and that the courts might see an adolescent gang member or a teenager convicted as an adult for serious criminal activity jennifer podkul policy director of kids in need of defense kind said congress included special procedural protections for immigrant children in a 2008 antitrafficking bill to make sure that a kid gets a fair shot in the courtroom these kids are by themselves telling a very complicated and oftentimes very traumatic story said podkul the approach of this memo which is much more suspicious is not going to help get to the truth of a childs story in cases where children are called to testify the old guidance instructed judges to seek to limit the amount of time the child is on the stand the new guidance says that judges should consider limiting the childs time on the stand without compromising due process for the opposing party which is generally a government prosecutor the memo leaves in a range of special accommodations made for children including allowing them to bring a pillow or booster seat or a toy book or other personal item it also maintains that cases involving unaccompanied minors should be heard on a separate docket when possible and that children should not be detained or transported with adults ,politicsNews,23-Dec-17,1

"As Republicans aim to ride economy to election victory, a warning from voters in key district", king of prussia pennsylvaniawashington reuters  in the fox  hound sports bar next to a shopping mall in suburban philadelphia four democrats are giving speeches to potential voters as they begin their journey to try to unseat republican congressman pat meehan in next years elections winning this congressional district  pennsylvanias 7th  is key to democrats hopes of gaining the 24 seats they need to retake the us house of representatives next november the stakes are high  control of the house would allow them to block president donald trumps legislative agenda on the surface democrats face a significant hurdle in nearly twothirds of 34 republicanheld districts that are top of the partys target list household income or job growth and often both have risen faster than state and national averages over the past two years according to a reuters analysis of census data graphic tmsnrtrs2bgq29k that is potentially votewinning news for republican incumbents who in speeches and television ads can trumpet a strengthening economy as a product of republican control of washington even though incomes and job growth began improving under former democratic president barack obama the good economy is really the only positive keeping republicans afloat said david wasserman a congressional analyst with the nonpartisan cook political report still trumpeting the good economy may have limited impact among voters in competitive districts like this mostly white southeast region of pennsylvania bordering delaware and new jersey which has switched between both parties twice in the past 15 years many of the two dozen voters that reuters interviewed in the 6th and 7th districts agreed the economy was strong that jobs were returning and wages were growing a handful were committed republicans and democrats who always vote the party line about half voted for meehan last year but most of those said they were unsure whether they would vote for him again in 2018 some said they were disappointed with the republican partys handling of healthcare and tax reform as well as trumps erratic performance about half also felt that despite an improving economy living costs are squeezing the middle class drew mcginty one of the democratic hopefuls at the fox  hound bar hoping to unseat meehan said the good economic numbers were misleading when i talk to people across the district i hear about stagnant wages i hear about massive debt young people are getting when they finish college theres a lot out there not being told by the numbers he said still meehan who won by 19 points in last novembers general election is confident the strong economy will help him next year he plans to run as a job creator and a champion of the middle class the first thing people look at is whether they have got a job and income meehan said in a telephone interview democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton carried the district by more than two points in the white house race giving democrats some hope that they can peel it away from republicans next november kyle kondik a political analyst at the university of virginia center for politics said the election will essentially be a referendum on trump the economy might help republicans he said but other issues will likely be uppermost in voters minds like the republican tax overhaul  which is seen by some as favoring the rich over the middle class  and trumps dismantling of president barack obamas initiative to expand healthcare to millions of americans popularly known as obamacare indeed healthcare is americans top concern according to a reutersipsos poll conducted earlier this month next is terrorism and then the economy healthcare will be the no 1 issue in the election predicted molly sheehan another democrat running to unseat meehan democrats have warned that dismantling obamacare will leave millions of americans without health coverage and political analysts say republicans in vulnerable districts could be punished by angry voters republicans argue that obamacare drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions in broomall a hamlet in the 7th district local builder greg dulgerian 55 said he voted for trump and meehan he still likes trump because of his image as a political outsider but he is less certain about meehan im busy which is good dulgerian said but i actually make less than i did 10 years ago because my living costs and costs of materials have gone up dulgerian said he was not sure what meehan was doing to address this and he was open to a democratic candidate with a plan to help the middle class ida mccausland 65 is a registered republican but said she is disappointed with the party she views the overhaul of the tax system as a giveaway to the rich that will hit the middle class i will probably just go democrat she said still others interviewed said the good economy was the most important issue for them and would vote for meehan mike allard 35 a stocks day trader voted for clinton last year but did not cast a ballot in the congressional vote he thinks the economy will help meehan next year and is leaning toward voting for him local businesses like the way the economy is going right now he said in the 7th district median household income jumped more than 10 percent from 2014 to 2016 from 78000 to around 86000 above the national average increase of 73 percent while job growth held steady the analysis of the census data shows overall the us economy has grown 3 percent in recent quarters and some forecasters now think the stimulus from the republican tax cuts will sustain that rate of growth through next year unemployment has dropped to 41 percent a 17year low in midterm congressional elections history shows that voters often focus on issues other than the economy in 1966 the economy was thriving but president lyndon b johnsons democrats suffered a net loss of 47 seats partly because of growing unhappiness with the vietnam war in 2006 again the economy was humming but republicans lost a net 31 seats in the house as voters focused on the iraq war and the unpopularity of republican president george w bush in 2010 despite pulling the economy out of a major recession democrats lost control of the house to republicans mainly because of the passage of obamacare which at the time was highly unpopular with many voters when times are bad the election is almost always about the economy when the economy is good people have the freedom and the ability to worry about other issues said stu rothenberg a veteran political analyst ,politicsNews,22-Dec-17,1
Exclusive: State Department tells refugee agencies to downsize U.S. operations,reuters  the us state department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in 2018 as president donald trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the united states the announcement was made at a dec 1 meeting in washington with state department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies several executives of the agencies said advocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into american life several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures refugee resettlement in the united states is handled by nine nonprofit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work they partner with or oversee hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school arranging doctors visits and applying for social security cards and other documents though the agencies are independent they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees aid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the state department in the dec 1 meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than 100 refugees in fiscal year 2018 will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals which means many of them will have to close there are about 300 resettlement offices spread across 49 states and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year the trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly both to promote national security and so that they can become selfsufficient refugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal they say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here they say if refugees lose access to services to help them navigate the processes of registering for school and english classes and finding a job that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the united states and contribute to our economy said robert carey who directed the office of refugee resettlement under former president barack obama a state department official confirmed the dec 1 meeting and said the agency is looking to reduce costs and simplify management structures to help the us refugee admissions program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable some conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agencies activities these organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much said jessica vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies there is no reason to keep funneling money to them joshua meservey a senior policy analyst at the conservative heritage foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement said that costs need to be balanced against benefits it is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expense of funding the smaller agencies he said the nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible several agency executives said were hoping that they the state department only close sites where there is possible duplication said mark hetfield president of hias one of the nine agencies this is going to have to be a negotiation and a process since taking office in january trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the united states because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes soon after taking office he slashed the 2017 us refugee cap to 50000 from the 110000 ceiling set by obama in september he announced a cap of 45000 for 2018 the lowest number since the modern us refugee program was established in 1980 the resettlement office in chattanooga tennessee is at risk of shutting down because it is only projected to receive about 85 refugees said holly johnson the states refugee coordinator small doesnt necessarily mean weak or subpar johnson said they spend more time with folks they have really wellestablished connections to the community so people feel welcomed which really helps until this year idaho had four resettlement offices  three in boise and one in twin falls said jan reeves director of the idaho office for refugees a nonprofit which administers resettlement in the state earlier this year one of the sites in boise shut down he said it was disruptive and weve lost a really valuable partner and weve lost some capacity to do the job he said ,politicsNews,21-Dec-17,1

lions share of benefits to corporations and the rich be careful what you wish for tom steyer a democratic billionaire said of republican leaders in an interview with reuters on wednesday they wanted this they should have never have wanted it now that theyve got it theyre going to wish they didnt steyer said he plans to use his money  through his political group nextgen america  to attack the

could be a rare wave election when one party seizes back control of congress it happened for republicans in 2010 and 1994 if democrats are able to pick up two more senate seats they will take control of the chamber and after the wins in alabama and virginia they are even hopeful they could tap into anger over tax cuts for the rich to win control of the house only about 29 percent of voters approve of the tax bill according to a reutersipsos poll conducted in mid december slightly more than 52 percent oppose it in no region of the country did even half of the people polled say they support it

the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and raises the threshold at which an inheritance is taxed it also cuts the tax rate for top earners while it also cuts the tax rate for most other income groups

made to the american people karp said republicans say democrats are indulging in wishful thinking polls say 50 percent of voters think their taxes will go up but tax analysts say that 80 percent will pay less tax republicans are counting on voters when they see more money in their paychecks to dismiss democratic rhetoric and perhaps even throw their support behind trump and if there are any unpleasant surprises in store for taxpayers they will not be filing their first tax returns under the new law until early 2019 months after the midterm elections republican strategist alex conant a veteran of congressional and presidential campaigns said the unpopularity of the tax cuts in opinion polls can be directly attributed to trumps low approval levels were losing elections because donald trump is incredibly unpopular and makes a lot of independents and soft republicans uncomfortable  trumps numbers are dragging down tax reforms numbers conant said although he also played down the electoral risks of the tax overhaul i would be very surprised if people are marching in the streets months from now because we cut their taxes republicans have some other advantages like the growing economy that means an attack on the tax overhaul could backfire democrats will have a very hard time taking this road if the economy is still going gang busters 11 months from now republican

Senator Cornyn trying to get Big Corn behind U.S. biofuels reform,reuters  senator john cornyn the no 2 senate republican is trying to win support from the midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nations biofuels policy according to sources familiar with the matter the effort comes as president donald trumps white house mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the renewable fuel standard which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of cornbased ethanol and other biofuels in the nations fuel supply every year oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nations refineries out of business ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it cornyn is working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the renewable fuel standard an aide to the senator told reuters the aide who asked not to be named did not provide details cornyn of texas the us state that is home to the most oil refineries is part of the senates leadership team responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the republican partys legislative agenda two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential rfs reform bill that could be dropped early next year however similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past any such effort would need the buyin of legislative backers of the ethanol industry like republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa the topproducing state for corn officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment both grassley and ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the rfs in its current form the white house has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over shortterm remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation the refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year and threatens to put some refineries out of business refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits called rins from rivals that do rin prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the rfs has increased refineries that buy rins include philadelphia energy solutions and monroe energy both of pennsylvania and valero energy corp of texas valero said rins cost it around 750 million last year though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs senator ted cruz also of texas last week sent a proposal to the white house to cap the price of rins at 10 cents each a fraction of the current price the proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry the ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a nonstarter and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the us gasoline supply the industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits lowering their prices prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in washington the price hit 68 cents on wednesday nearing a sevenmonth low according to traders and oil price information services the white house has not yet commented on cruzs proposal the rfs was introduced by former president george w bush as a way to boost us agriculture slash energy imports and cut emissions it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year the refining industry has pressed the trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far ,politicsNews,20-Dec-17,1
"In Georgia, battle of the 'Staceys' tests Democrats' future",atlanta reuters  the two democratic candidates running for governor in georgia are both lawyers and former state legislators both are women and on many policy issues its hard to tell them apart both even share the same first name  stacey but they sharply disagree on the path to victory stacey abrams 44 wants to become the first african american female governor in the united states by mobilizing solidly democratic black voters who vote sporadically in elections to form a winning coalition with white liberals stacey evans 39 thinks the math does not add up without also appealing to white moderates many of them outside urban areas who voted for president donald trump last november she is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the democratic party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent democratic victories in alabama and virginia as the party prepares for the 2018 congressional elections there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on  minority voters who are a fastgrowing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots or bluecollar and suburban whites who swing between parties graphic tmsnrtrs2yykchv reuters interviews with liberal activist groups some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on abrams strategy as the best shot at turning a republican state underscoring the stakes in georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left their level of early support for abrams is largely unparalleled among other 2018 gubernatorial and many congressional races a dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind abrams according to a reuters tally even though the democratic primary or nominating contest is still months away the breadth of that support has been little reported abrams who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the south argues that democrats have wasted resources on swing voters we have left too many voters untouched she said in an interview noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion gay rights and labor unions to appeal to republicanleaning voters her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views but you are going to have to persuade some moderate republicans to vote for you if you are going to win in georgia said evans who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another after losing the white house last year the democratic party found itself powerless in washington some in the party faulted their presidential nominee hillary clinton for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states others blamed her

among african americans according to the pew research center only half of georgias black voters cast ballots in 2016 compared to more than twothirds of whites a reuters review of state records showed the democratic national committee said the recent wins in alabama and virginia show that democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a party jennifer duffy a political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report said boosting democratic turnout could work as a strategy but she urged caution  focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate democrats and swing voters especially in suburban areas also played a role in the recent democratic victories she noted university of georgia political science professor charles bullock agreed the numbers are there if democrats do not lose more white voters at the abrams campaign headquarters a poster titled how we win points out that democrats in georgia have lost recent elections by some 200000 votes more than 1 million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governors race in 2014 state data shows they dont vote because we dont ask and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking abrams said speaking on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers abrams a tax attorney and romance novelist who led democrats in the state legislature said her campaign has already reached out to more than 300000 voters with door knocks phone calls and text messages she hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen

model of how to engage the nations increasingly diverse electorate politics is changing in america and abrams path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm said dan cantor national

campaign democracy for america is similarly engaging nearly 35000 members in the state officials said the group has already raised nearly 25000 for abrams an unusually high sum for an election still a year away a group called powerpac is organizing a 10 million getoutthevote effort with plans to hire people to contact minority voters and use targeted radio phone and digital campaigns individual donors from outside georgia have contributed more than half of the 470000 in larger donations that abrams has reported according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance records billionaire george soros one of the democratic partys biggest financial backers and two sons donated 21000 each by contrast evans is not receiving many donations from outside of georgia nor national endorsements her campaign is focused on restoring cuts to a state college scholarship called hope most of her money has come from instate donors who have fueled almost all of her reported 390000 in major donations she has support from georgias last democratic governor as well as a bigname democratic strategist paul begala who worked for the governor who created the scholarship the georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away and those who want to drill deeper into the partys base to increase turnout said begala calling it an utterly false choice it is like a football team saying do you play offense or defense begala said you have to do both at a recent barbecue luncheon in athens evans pointed out that she

"Tax bill's 'pass-through' rule will aid wealthy, not workers: critics",washington reuters  wealthy business owners such as president donald trump stand to gain from a provision in the republican tax bill that creates a valuable deduction for owners of passthrough businesses democrats and some tax experts say the provision creates a 20percent business income deduction with some limits for sole proprietors and owners in partnerships and other noncorporate enterprises it was initially sold by republicans as a way to help small businesses and create jobs but the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit has widened to take in companies with few if any workers critics said the president will try to tell the american people that his great political victory is a win for working people but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses real estate passthroughs democratic senator jack reed said on the senate floor trump a real estate developer wants to sign the republican tax bill into law this week which would give republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017 the house of representatives and senate were hurrying toward passage of the bill on tuesday with a final house vote set for wednesday on house speaker paul ryans website he said passthrough businesses employed about half of us privatesector workers high tax rates he said discourage investment and job creation discourage business activity and put american businesses at a competitive disadvantage passthrough businesses profits pass through their books directly to owners unlike corporations which parcel out profits through dividends to stockholders under existing law passthrough owners pay the individual income tax rate on those profits not the corporate rate under the republican bill the corporate rate would be slashed to 21 percent while the top individual income tax rate which some passthrough business owners pay would be 37 percent to address the disparity republicans included tax relief for passthrough owners in their bill allowing them to deduct 20 percent of their passthrough business income republicans put in antiabuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim the 20 percent deduction and prevent high earners from seeking to recategorize their income as passthrough income to take advantage of the deduction republicans also capped the income eligible for the full 20percent deduction at 315000 for married couples and 157500 for individuals but they included a capital element in the formula for determining eligibility beyond those thresholds presenting a lucrative tax break for some including wealthy owners of commercial property said tax experts this seems ideally suited for commercial property businesses where there arent a lot of workers but there is a lot of valuable property around said steven rosenthal senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center a think tank income above the passthrough caps can be eligible for the 20percent deduction based on a formula 50 percent of employee wages paid or 25 percent of wages plus 25 percent of the value of qualified property at purchase whichever is greater the idea is to use the sum of the 25 percent rule plus 25 percent of wages  to get the full 20percent deduction on more income said new york university school of law professor daniel shaviro a tax law specialist in an email an assessment of the republican bill by 13 tax experts mostly academics said the formula would expand the ability of highly paid owners in certain industries  and particularly those heavy in property but light in employees like real estate  to qualify for the passthrough deduction ,politicsNews,20-Dec-17,1
U.S. tax cuts won't make housing more affordable: analysts,reuters  the us tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by reuters with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it a decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off us home values and led to a deep global recession the housing market has bounced back smartly us house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019 faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages that is in sharp contrast to the outlook for britain gbhomes the spcase shiller composite index of us home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 51 percent next year and 42 percent in 2019 the main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers who tend to be young and not particularly wellpaid and if universityeducated already saddled with huge amounts of debt now adding to those concerns is an effort by president donald trumps administration to overhaul the tax code which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market the republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to 750000 down from the current 1 million the house of representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on tuesday afternoon and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said his chamber would vote on tuesday evening twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes  of having deductibility limited  makes housing less attractive and less affordable said robert brusca chief economist at fao economics but he added the trumpcongress plan is such a notwellthoughtoutmess its hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive the median answer was 6 while the latest consensus on us housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling the range of forecasts has narrowed we think theres a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth housing affordability could take a turn for the worse noted ralph mclaughlin economist at trulia in san francisco this is because the housing market has a supply not a demand problem so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are another challenge has been lingering for years while the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17year low of 41 percent annual wage growth has not broken above 29 percent since the great recession that ended about eight years ago home prices have been appreciating circa 56 percent well above wage growth at 225 percent decreasing affordability for the average buyer particularly firsttime homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel in chicago she also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable the latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis existing home sales rose to a seasonallyadjusted annualized rate of 548 million units in october but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005 property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5556 million less than the 570millionunit pace hit in march which was the highest since february 2007 those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a reuters poll in august but data on monday showed us singlefamily homebuilding and permits rose in november to a level not seen since august 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 1812year high in december in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints the us federal reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year while lifting shortterm rates wont necessarily push up longerterm market rates the path of least resistance is higher still the latest reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in august the 30year mortgage rate is expected to average 424 percent next year rising to 465 percent in 2019 and 500 percent in 2020 analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the fed would significantly slow activity if there are more than three hikes it is likely that the fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up  and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates said david berson chief economist at nationwide insurance in columbus ohio ,politicsNews,19-Dec-17,1

the onetime tax pop well see if theres any follow through next year on the rise in treasury yields its been a monetary policyled expansion now we get a fiscal boost and some may be concerned that the boost on the fiscal side may be offset by monetary tightening the big question for the dollar is how other central banks will respond to this us fiscal stimulus package thats probably whats weighing on investors minds right now  celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away jim paulsen chief investment strategist the leuthold group minneapolis as we look back on this a little bit i really think it might be buy the rumor sell the news wall street has had long enough to vet this thing and it has been known for a long time that something was going to pass here at least for the last 30 45 days whether it was going to be 21 percent rate or 20 percent rate is not that significant its more the general parts of it were pretty much known and vetted and i think implemented into the market if you look at the relative performance in the market today its fairly clearly more of a shot towards better economic growth or even inflation i think the biggest move today of anything is bond yields thats the big story aaron kohli interest rate strategist bmo capital markets new york they seem to have locked up all the necessary votes i think the markets are still trying to figure out how much should we expect will people react right away what will be the second order effects there are a lot of questions that still havent answered the first one is assuming it goes into effect jan 1 when is the first time people start seeing any changes in their pay checks and the answer is it could be a couple of months even then for most of middle america you arent going to see the savings until tax time which means you may not see it until april 2019 im not sure thats early enough to help midterms and i think thats really where the markets are going to start to focus next how do we handicap what it does for republicans in the midterms does it help them does it do nothing for them or it may even hurt them brian peery portfolio manager hennessy funds in novato california the market is taking kind of a breather digesting the news the market is off a little bit maybe because the bill is not as popular as the gop hoped it would be in the public opinion the overall market looks still really strong and healthy looking at companies in our portfolio the tax bill will be great for domestic small and midcap companies paying a 30 35 percent effective tax rate a lot of them do not have the ability to move profits offshore ill wait and see how much but i can see another 5 percent rise in the market in the next few months as the tax bill kicks in alicia levine director of portfolio strategy at bny mellon investment management new york the effects of the tax cuts will be immediately accretive to corporate earnings which will support equity markets also the tax package will be positive for growth in the real economy the tax cuts add 10 to baseline sp earnings for 2018 putting 2018 expected earnings at 156 or a 19 percent growth rate over 2017 earnings this is supportive of equity markets sectors to focus on would be small caps value and financials paul nolte portfolio manager at kingsview asset management in chicago its pretty much along party lines the takeaway is more buy the rumor sell the news the market has been rallying over the last week or so in anticipation of this vote were now going to be looking toward the government funding bill its going to take time to see how the general population reacts to it tax the expectation is companies are going to bring back a lot of dollars back to the united states and put it into plant and equipment it very well may go into stock buybacks and dividend increases theres no certainty were going to get the promised economic gain everybodys been talking about chuck carlson chief executive officer horizon investment services hammond indiana i think the market had been pretty well expecting this i dont think theres any  surprise here to the market the momentum had been pretty strong in the last two weeks in terms of getting this done and i think the market has pretty well anticipated getting it done you may see some reactions going forward in certain sectors and subcategories maybe you see smallcaps pick up a little bit more maybe you see the transports which have lagged large caps start to do a little bit better but in the main the market had already been factoring this in it has a lot of potential ramifications its going to certainly play a role in the midterm elections next year and people are going to have some time to try to evaluate whether their plight in life is better because of it before they go to the voting booth next year so from a political standpoint it has impact omair sharif senior us economist societe generale new york this seems like its a done deal especially if corker and collins end up on board on the senate side they will get across the finish line by christmas after moving the goal post a number of times i think for more than a few days now this was likely going to pass this has been baked in the cake with the markets they have been expecting this for a long time its a few days before christmas so trading is quite thin i wouldnt read too much into any market reaction the real telling thing for this is the second half of next year whether this actually lifts growth above 3 percent on any sustained basis on capital spending and consumer spending its more a political achievement than an economic achievement stocks trimmed losses slightly but then dipped back the sp 500 index was last down 03 percent treasury yields hovered near session highs and the dollar held its gains against the yen,politicsNews,19-Dec-17,1

first vision reflects a view long held by us diplomats that russia actively undermines american interests at home and abroad despite trumps own bid for warmer ties with president vladimir putin through modernized forms of subversive tactics russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world said the document it avoided directly citing what us intelligence agencies say was russian meddling in last years us presidential election russia uses information operations as part of its offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe its

debtfinanced cuts for businesses the wealthy and some middleclass americans  and picked up crucial support from two wavering senators ahead of planned votes by lawmakers early next week passage of the

after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged support three republican senators enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trumps party controls with a slim 5248 majority remained uncommitted susan collins jeff flake and mike lee the final version hammered out between senate and house of representatives republicans after each chamber previously passed competing versions contained no surprises it would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent according to a summary distributed to reporters by congressional tax writers corporate tax lobbyists have been seeking a tax cut of this magnitude for many years the bill the summary showed would create a 20percent business income tax deduction for owners of passthrough businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships allow for immediate writeoff by corporations of new equipment costs and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax under a new territorial system the bill would exempt us corporations from taxes on most of their future foreign profits it also sets a onetime tax for companies to repatriate more than 26 trillion now held overseas at rates of 155 percent for cash and cashequivalents and 8 percent for illiquid assets if passed by congress the changes would be in effect for 2018 taxes with tax returns for 2017 unaffected democrats have been unified

democratic presidential nomination last year called the bill a moral and economic obscenity it is a gift to wealthy republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our

already expanding for months trump has touted the bill as a middleclass tax cut studies from independent analysts and nonpartisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately the republican bill would maintain the existing seven individual and family income tax brackets with rates of 10 12 22 24 32 35 and 37 percent that top rate for the highestearning americans would be cut from todays 396 percent republicans abandoned their quest to eliminate the estate tax on inherited assets a move that would have benefited the richest americans but they did propose increasing the exemption for the tax to 10 million from 5 million person the bill does not eliminate wall streets socalled carried interest loophole that allows fund managers to claim a lower capital gains tax rate on profits from investments held more than a year getting rid of the loophole was a trump campaign pledge instead the legislation makes it harder for

Do not expect postcard-sized tax return from Republican plan: experts,washington reuters  since mid2016 us house speaker paul ryan has carried around a postcard that he has said shows how easy it will be for americans to file their taxes once republicans are finished their tax overhaul and as recently as thursday president donald trump touted americans being able to file their taxes on a single little beautiful sheet of paper with lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in 30 years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year the moment should be near when ryans postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality right its kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when first no one is going to put their social security number on a postcard and second you already have a giant postcard in the form of the 1040ez mark mazur a director of the nonpartisan tax policy center said citing a 14line internal revenue service irs tax form representatives from the 11 billion us tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary i dont think youre going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone said mark steber chief tax officer at jackson hewitt tax service inc jakhtul i think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature the irs would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul however the irs estimates that despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier 90 percent of americans use tax preparation services such as jackson hewitt hr block inc and liberty tax inc or tax software such as turbotax from intuit inc if congress enacts the republican plan into law it would not affect 2017 taxyear returns filed in 2018 but in 2019 millions of middleclass americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions credits and other tax breaks a key driver of this according to independent analyses would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments in combination these two changes would mean that about 29 million people would no longer benefit from itemizing so they would stop writing off their charitable donations mortgage interest and state and local tax payments according to the institute on taxation and economic policy a think tank itemized deductions for medical expenses investment interest unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many personal exemptions for individual taxpayers which now take up a lot of space on tax forms would also be eliminated such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms the irs expects 24 million people in 2018 to file the longest and most widely used irs form today the form 1040 which is 79 lines long about 46 million people will use the 14line 1040ez wealthy americans likely would still itemize under the republican plan owning businesses homes and other factors could also lead to taxes being more complicated than what filers could describe on a postcard even though were talking about simplification for a large number of taxpayers theres still many taxpayers who will have complicated tax situations and well be there to help them as well said david williams chief tax officer for turbotax adds first name title in 4th paragraph ,politicsNews,14-Dec-17,1
"Republicans forge tax deal, final votes seen next week",washington reuters  congressional republicans reached a deal on final tax legislation on wednesday clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the us corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans under an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years as they finalized the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years republicans wavered for weeks on whether to slash the top income tax rate for the wealthy in the end they agreed to cut it to 37 percent from the current 396 percent that was despite criticism from democrats that the republican plan tilts toward the rich and corporations offering little to the middle class i think weve got a pretty good deal senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters the emerging agreement would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax set up to ensure profitable companies pay some federal tax and expand a proposed 10000 cap for state and local property tax deductions to include income tax lawmakers and sources familiar with the negotiations said it was also expected to limit the popular mortgage interest deduction to home loans of no more than 750000 and provide the owners of passthrough businesses such as sole proprietorships and partnerships with a 20 percent business income deduction the deal would gut part of the obamacare health law by repealing a federal fine on individuals who fail to obtain health insurance while authorizing oil drilling in alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge both addon measures were part of nailing down sufficient votes for passage moving the corporate tax target rate to 21 percent from 20 percent gave tax writers enough revenue to make the tax cuts immediate republican senator ron johnson told reporters news of the deal began circulating just before a formal housesenate conference committee began debating it in public leading democrats to decry the gathering as a sham a final bill could be formally unveiled on friday with decisive votes expected next week in both chambers despite expressions of confidence about passage from party leaders the path to a final vote in the senate could still be perilous republicans who hold a 5248 majority in the 100seat senate can lose no more than two votes on the tax bill republican senator john mccain who has brain cancer was in a military hospital to undergo treatment for the side effects of cancer therapy at least three other senate republicans still seemed to be undecided including arizonas jeff flake who was not specific about his hesitation in brief hallway remarks to reporters bob corker a fiscal hawk said he was undecided on whether to support the bill he told reporters my deficit

Alabama win thrills Democrats as Republicans point fingers,washington reuters  democrats said on wednesday their us senate victory in alabama could lead to a sweeping comeback for the party in 2018 elections while republicans sought to assess blame for a defeat in one of the countrys most conservative states doug jones a democrat and former federal prosecutor won the special election on tuesday night after a bitter campaign that drew national attention amid sexual misconduct accusations against conservative republican candidate roy moore president donald trump had endorsed moore and the loss was a stunning upset for him and fellow republicans narrowing their majority in the senate to 5149 it also boosted democrats who hope to retake control of congress in elections next november trump speaking to reporters at the white house said the alabama outcome would not affect his policy agenda republicans are rushing to pass a tax overhaul package by the end of the year jones is expected to take office in early january after the election results are certified wish we would have gotten the seat trump said a lot of republicans feel differently theyre very happy with the way it turned out at a news conference in birmingham alabama on wednesday jones said he received congratulatory calls from trump as well as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a republican and senator chuck schumer the democratic leader some congressional republicans were quick on wednesday to slam former trump strategist steve bannon for his steadfast support of moore saying it split the party and paved the way for jones shocking victory jones 63 was the first democrat elected to the senate from alabama in a quartercentury and the party sees potential nationwide this campaign has given a lot of people a reason to believe jones said schumer said the defeat of moore reflected a distaste among voters for trumps policies which he said help the wealthy and powerful to the detriment of the middle class things are looking good for us schumer told reporters if they republicans continue to run the government for the benefit of the few special powerful wealthy interests there will be many more alabamas in 2018 some senate republicans expressed relief that moore would not be joining their ranks including bob corker a frequent trump critic who is retiring next year i know were supposed to cheer for our side of the aisle  but im really really happy with what happened for all of us in our nation for people serving in the senate to not have to deal with what we were likely going to have to deal with should the outcome have been the other way corker said bannon trumps former chief white house strategist worked hard for moore as part of his broader campaign against more centrist republican leaders and his critics were quick to attack on wednesday this guy does not belong on the national stage republican representative peter king said on cnn hes not representing what i stand for i consider myself a conservative republican  and he sort of parades himself out there with his weird altright views that he has and to me its demeaning the whole governmental and political process moore a hardline conservative who was twice removed from his seat on the alabama supreme court for refusing to abide by federal law became the republican candidate by beating incumbent senator luther strange in a primary race earlier this year strange had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by republican jeff sessions when he became trumps attorney general mcconnell and other republican leaders in congress backed strange in that race and then pressured moore to withdraw his candidacy after he faced allegations from several women that he sexually assaulted or pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s moore 70 denied the accusations mcconnell who has been a frequent bannon target declined to address bannons role in the race when speaking to reporters on wednesday it was quite an impressive election mcconnell said it was a big turnout and an unusual day strange had harsh words for bannon he has accomplished one thing that i dont think anybody in america thought was possible and thats getting a democrat elected in the state of alabama strange said on fox news channel trump backed strange in the republican primary but then endorsed moore and threw his full support behind him even as other party leaders in washington walked away trump tried to minimize the damage to his own credibility on wednesday the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election i was right he said on twitter roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him some republicans defended trump it had zero to do with donald trump republican representative bradley byrne of alabama told msnbc calling the race a purely weird unique election as of wednesday night moore had not conceded the race to jones saying in a video statement that there are military and provisional ballots still to be counted and that the campaign was waiting for certification by the secretary of state we are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic our civilization and our religion and to set free a suffering humanity he said and the battle rages on jones victory was not expected to affect pending votes in congress on funding the government or the republican overhaul of the tax code republican congressional leaders have vowed to get the tax changes approved before christmas the alabama outcome could push democrats to make sexual harassment a key election issue at a time when many powerful men in entertainment the media and politics  including trump  have faced accusations of misconduct such a move could help boost support from women the results also highlighted jones success in mobilizing africanamericans voters who constituted about 30 percent of those voting on tuesday and overwhelmingly voted democratic according to network exit polls jones also fared surprisingly well in suburban counties outside of cities such as birmingham and huntsville a trend that has republicans nervous ahead of next years elections when dozens of congressional districts are likely to be highly competitive part of the reason for that in alabama was that many upscale republican voters did not vote as compared with last years presidential election ,politicsNews,12-Dec-17,1

alabama coupled with last months democratic sweep in virginia has given the party new optimism about its 2018 prospects in the south and other conservative heavily rural regions where republicans have dominated for decades jones a former federal prosecutor took advantage of the controversy over sexual misconduct allegations against his republican opponent roy moore to become the first democrat elected to the us senate in alabama in a quartercentury the jones campaign also offered a template for how democrats can win in the south strategists said field a strong candidate crank up turnout among the regions sizable bloc of africanamerican voters keep the liberal national party brand at arms length and compete hard in every county and region add in the grassroots energy of the liberal resistance to president donald trump the disaffection of moderate suburbanites turned off by trump and a conservative wing sapped of enthusiasm by republican infighting and democrats see an opportunity for a brighter future in the south starting in next years midterm elections you can hear that republican wall in the south cracking doug jones and virginia are just the beginning said phil noble a democratic business and technology consultant who is running for governor in south carolina republicans are not convinced citing years of still unrealized democratic predictions that demographic changes would turn republicandominated conservative states like georgia and texas into tossups democrats still have issues with their brand in large swaths of the country they are the party of nancy pelosi and that image is cemented in many voters minds said brian walsh a former strategist for the republican partys senate campaign committee referring to the house of representatives democratic leader a liberal from san francisco in the fight for control of congress next year wins on once hostile southern turf could be crucial to the democratic cause in the senate where republicans already narrow majority will be shaved to 5149 once jones is seated democrats will have to defend 26 seats including 10 in states won by trump they would need to pick up two more republicanheld states to reclaim control nevada and arizona had been viewed as the only republicanheld seats vulnerable to a takeover next year but democrats now see possibilities in tennessee where popular former democratic governor phil bredesen has jumped into the race for the seat of retiring republican bob corker and mississippi where incumbent republican roger wicker could face a bruising primary challenge in the house of representatives democrats need to gain 24 seats to win a majority their target list of 91 districts includes one each in alabama arkansas and kentucky two in georgia and four in north carolina if the election were held today i do think you could see democrats winning in some areas of the country where democrats havent won in the last decade said zac mccrary a democratic pollster based in alabama in addition to the congressional races governors contests in georgia and south carolina and state legislative races across the region will give democrats a shot to compete in areas where they once dominated local politics but are now a minority party defined by liberal views on cultural issues such as abortion and gay rights mccrary said jones and democrat john bel edwards who won the louisiana governors office in 2015 have shown it is possible to build a winning coalition in the south by energizing africanamerican voters while also appealing to white swing voters soft republicans and independents in alabama jones made inroads with voters in shelby county the republican suburbs of the states biggest city birmingham outpolling the results of hillary clinton there in last years presidential election by about 20 percentage points that should be a warning sign to republicans after trumps weak performance in wealthier more educated suburban districts in 2016 and democrat jon ossoffs strong though ultimately losing bid in a special election earlier this year for a congressional seat in a suburban atlanta district that has been long held by republicans said david hughes a professor at auburn universitymontgomery in alabama if democrats want to get out of the ditch they are in in alabama and the south they will do it in the suburbs said

acknowledged on wednesday that the national party kept a low profile in alabama even as it pumped money into turnout efforts targeting blacks and young voters because it knew that publicity about its involvement would not help jones but perez said the victory showed that the party which has launched a 50state organizing effort aimed at electing candidates at the local and state levels can compete in the south and elsewhere we can win in every zip code in america perez told reporters democrats in alabama said the party can start by learning lessons from jones who campaigned in every corner of the state and portrayed himself as a bridge builder who would listen to voters concerns and work across the aisle to help alabama this is what we need to be doing more of and not just at election time

Trump loses his big bet on Alabama U.S. Senate race,washington reuters  in backing roy moore in alabamas us senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls president donald trump made a risky bet  and lost big the victory by democrat doug jones over the republican moore in the alabama special election on tuesday was a catastrophe for trump portending a democratic wave next year that could cost republicans control of one or both houses of congress the stakes in alabama were that high democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the us house of representatives in next years congressional elections jones narrow victory increases their oncelong odds of retaking control of the senate as well if democrats were to recapture both chambers they would serve as a check on trumps agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him that republicans lost in one of the most republican states in the nation is a wakeup call no matter how flawed their candidate was said jesse ferguson a democratic strategist and former aide to democrat hillary clintons presidential campaign democrats never expected to have a chance in alabama where they had not won a us senate race in 25 years but the combination of trumps unpopularity the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against moore in november and trumps enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity experts said trump was the one who got jones within firing range and moore allowed jones to win said kyle kondik a political analyst at the university of virginia even as democrats lost several special congressional elections this year they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement which is attributable to trump kondik said the alabama race showed there were limits both to trumps endorsement power and his judgment even as senior republicans urged trump to abandon moore the president decided instead in the campaigns final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him in the end that was not enough and early turnout reports suggested that many republicans stayed home moreover despite the sexual misconduct allegations against moore the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president moores camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on trump and his presidency it is donald trump on trial in alabama dean young a strategist for moore told abc news trump congratulated jones on twitter on a hard fought victory and added republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time the loss was also a body blow to steve bannon trumps former top strategist who backed moore in the primary against the republican incumbent luther strange because he viewed moore as a more reliable ally bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about alabama and more about furthering trumps economic nationalist agenda bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the republican establishment in the 2018 congressional elections particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who condemned moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s moore 70 has denied the allegations and reuters has not independently verified them antiestablishment beyond moore bannon is supporting antiestablishment candidates such as kelli ward in arizona danny tarkanian in nevada and kevin nicholson in wisconsin all of whom oppose mcconnell staying on as senate leader bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting republicans in mississippi and wyoming but moores loss seems certain to dampen that effort and republicans who fear losing control of congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters it is now an open question whether trump will inject himself into more republican primaries given his setback in alabama when you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party you run the risk of ruining your entire brand said josh holmes a republican consultant and close

"Exclusive: Contenders emerge for No.2 Fed job, search to narrow", in this dec 8 story corrects peters affiliation in paragraph 12 to reflect company name change by jonathan spicer and rob cox new york reuters  the federal reserve bank of new york will soon narrow its search for candidates to fill what is considered the feds secondmost powerful job after having scouted a diverse field from a local business school dean to a former fed governor new york fed president william dudley steps down in mid2018 and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists academics investors bankers and policymakers they are looking beyond the traditional mold of an expert in banking markets or monetary policy and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days said one person in contact with the directors the new york fed president is at the intersection of us monetary policy and financial markets and is responsible for the policing of wall street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy the new york fed boss is nominated by the regional banks board of directors rather than the white house and does not require congressional approval dudleys successor could play an even greater role guiding the fed through a historic leadership change in which us president donald trump can fill six of the seven seats on the fed board of governors he has so far named jerome powell and randal quarles  lawyers not phd economists  to top positions in washington with powell replacing chair janet yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term both men support the republican push for wall street deregulation yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the feds tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn by now the new york fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like according to people familiar with the search two of those people who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process said search firms have contacted among several others peter blair henry 48 dean of new york universitys stern school of business and former fed governor kevin warsh warsh 47 who was in the running for fed chair before trump picked powell last month declined to be considered for the new york job they said one of these people said henry appeared to be the early frontrunner henry and a spokeswoman for warsh at stanford universitys hoover institution where he is a visiting fellow did not respond to requests for comment the permanentvoting fed

billion in assets told reuters still the feds board of governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by new yorks fourmember search committee led by liberalleaning directors sara horowitz and glenn hutchins horowitz founder of the freelancers union which advocates for independent workers chairs the new york feds board hutchins is cofounder of privateequity firm silver lake partners and a noted publicpolicy philanthropist several weeks before dudleys resignation announcement in early november the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background but also race and gender according to those familiar with the effort the new york fed declined to comment in a video posted on its website last month the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from teambuilding and sensitivity to local economic trends to intellectual leadership and crisis management the initial search effort suggests the next new york fed chief could have a different background than dudley and his predecessors who tended to be bankers or market economists with wall street or us treasury experience and who were all white and male dudley was chief economist at goldman sachs before joining the fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the no 2 policymaker behind yellen at the time of his departure the new york fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently 44trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis a task that would favor candidates with market experience jamaicaborn henry who will step down as sterns dean at year end would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the feds upper ranks a review of henrys public papers and comments reveal little about his views on us monetary policy or financial supervision though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the new york feds role as foreign liaison if chosen he would become the institutions first black president those who have spoken to new york fed directors said past and present insiders as well as outsiders were considered among them were simon potter the head of the new york feds markets desk brian sack his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund de shaw and lorie logan potters deputy they said the

Powell faces early test of policy view as tax cuts near approval,washington reuters  incoming federal reserve chair jerome powell chosen by us president donald trump to keep the recovery humming appears set to let an expected trilliondollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered powell in statements throughout the year culminating with his recent senate confirmation hearing has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the fed to raise rates faster than expected and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs new data added evidence to that view on friday employment in november grew faster than expected but wage growth remained muted the share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady sixyear recovery that is approaching its precrisis peak even with the unemployment rate at a 17year low of 41 percent theres no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market powell told members of the senate banking committee saying that the fed should raise rates only gradually debate among powells colleagues meanwhile has highlighted other risks if the fed speeds its pace of rate increases some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak others have noted that if the fed continues raising shortterm rates while longterm rates remain stalled it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down a typical signal of recession if the fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesnt materialize and they take rates too far then markets would feel aggrieved said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust in chicago and a former senior risk official at the fed board other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when powell takes over in february the tax cuts could kick in and the fed stands aside with a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework powell will lead a more datadriven fed which at the current juncture means a more dovish fed until and if inflation recovers said robin brooks chief economist at the institute of international finance he expects the fed under powell to only raise rates twice next year policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the republican tax plan when they meet next week they are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year they will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear top republicans from the house and the senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law though janet yellen remains fed chair until february her final scheduled press conference on wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop powell inherits the 64yearold lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor and help shape the statement issued that day by the federal open market committee it is a group struggling with a fundamental issue the economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment a condition in which prices and wages should be rising yet both remain weak into that mix the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households if there is still slack in the economy that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase and more workers are hired however if the economy is near or above its potential as some measures indicate it may merely cause fasterthandesired price increases or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble as the tax plan advanced in congress forecasting shops at goldman sachs jp morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of fed rate increases  essentially expecting the fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome the tax package is ultimately worth almost two additional fed hikes in coming years goldman sachs economists david mericle and alec phillips wrote in a recent analysis but the new chairs own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the feds goslow approach can continue giving more time for workers to rebound from the 20072009 crisis without creating other economic risks accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth rather it helped restore full employment powell said in june in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top fed job his outlook is consistent with positions trump and current chair janet yellen have taken and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the feds debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan at his confirmation hearing powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain but when asked about fed staff research that challenged a key republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs powell kept his distance its just someones research powell told senators dont associate that with a position of the board

Democrats eye gains in Pennsylvania trial on 'goofy' gerrymandering,lower merion pa reuters  in pennsylvania state senator daylin leachs bid to win a seat vital to the democratic partys chances in 2018 elections of taking control of the us congress his opponents may not be his biggest obstacle leach is running in one of the countrys most gerrymandered congressional districts one with such a twisting winding shape that it has earned the derisive nickname goofy kicking donald duck the 7th congressional district has become a national poster child for critics of gerrymandering the process by which one party draws district boundaries to ensure an advantage among voters democrats say the lines have helped republicans like us representative patrick meehan the fourterm incumbent leach seeks to unseat to stay in office that could soon change however on monday in state court in harrisburg one of three lawsuits challenging those boundaries heads to trial the outcome could shift several battleground districts in pennsylvania and in turn boost the democrats in the us house of representatives where they last held the majority from january 2007 to january 2011 the 7th district is so precisely engineered that at one point it narrows to the width of a single seafood restaurant snaking past two other congressional districts so it can link two far flung republicanleaning areas three congressional districts all converge on this spot leach said from the parking lot at creeds seafood and steaks last week as cars whizzed overhead on the pennsylvania turnpike this is the sixth over there is the seventh and down that road is the 13th he said pointing in several directions this is what gerrymandering looks like on the ground leach has at least four opponents to defeat in the democratic primary before he would run against meehan a spokesman for the republican did not respond to requests for comment on the trial over gerrymandering critics of gerrymandering say it helps explain why pennsylvania has sent 13 republicans and only five democrats to the us house since the 2011 redistricting despite being a closely divided swing state republican legislators counter that the lines were drawn in accordance with the law and that their candidates have prevailed in elections thanks to superior policy ideas the democrats have targeted six republicanheld districts in the state as part of their quest to pick up the 24 house seats they need to overturn the republicans who also have a senate majority and president donald trump in the white house democrats need to win the nationwide popular vote by at least 10 points in 2018 to do so in part because of gerrymandered lines according to michael li a redistricting expert and lawyer at new york universitys brennan center for justice pennsylvania is probably the most aggressive of the gerrymanders he said you look at some of the maps in the philadelphia suburbs and it looks like a 4yearold just slapped paint around the nonpartisan league of women voters of pennsylvania sued the state in june arguing the maps violate the state constitution by depriving residents of a meaningful vote the litigation is part of a growing set of legal challenges to partisan redistricting including a us supreme court case out of wisconsin that could for the first time establish a constitutional standard to measure the legality of such mapmaking the high court is scheduled to decide that case by june 2018 five months before the midterm elections the politicians are not supposed to pick their voters the voters are supposed to elect their leaders said mimi mckenzie an attorney with the public interest law center who represents the league of women voters and other pennsylvania voters spokesmen for the states republican legislative leaders defendants in the case said the redistricting followed the process laid out in the state constitution and that the us supreme court has said political considerations can play a role they just cant understand how republicans can actually beat their candidates stephen miskin a spokesman for pennsylvania house speaker mike turzai said of the legal challengers in addition to the state case two pending federal lawsuits also challenge the district lines as unconstitutional legal observers consider the state lawsuit the most likely to succeed in time for the voting next november the democraticmajority state supreme court has ordered the presiding judge to render his decision by dec 31 the high court will then determine whether to accept his ruling or issue its own conclusions the state lawsuit asserts the redistricting included numerous examples of blatantly partisan lines democratdominated reading one of the most economically depressed cities in the state was carved out

Special Counsel Mueller filing shows Manafort drafted Ukraine op-ed despite gag order,washington reuters on friday   us special counsel robert mueller late on friday unveiled a trove of evidence against president donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort to convince a judge that he violated a gag order by ghostwriting an article to bolster his public image the evidence mueller revealed in a filing which is a fraction of what he said earlier on friday he has collected is the first clear indication of the depth of his investigation and the nature of what his investigators have found in the 41page filing prosecutors in muellers office produced emails drafts with tracked edits and records showing that a computer user named paul manafort created a version of the oped and made numerous changes on november 29 between 841 pm and 911 pm and last saved at 912 pm they also produced records indicating that the oped published on thursday in the englishlanguage kyiv post over muellers objections tracked talking points manafort and his business associate richard gates wrote in august 2016 that was after manafort was forced to resign from trumps campaign because of political work he had done for prorussian figures including former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych mueller also claimed in the filing that manafort collaborated on the piece with konstantin kilimnik a russian to whom mueller alluded in a filing earlier this week as having ties to russian intelligence the filing did not disclose how muellers team acquired the data and jason maloni a spokesman for manafort declined to comment on it in the filing muellers team argued that us district court for the district of columbia judge amy berman jackson should deny a request by manafort to lift his house arrest saying the oped violated her gag order and demonstrated that he cannot be trusted bail is fundamentally about trust the filing said even taken in the light most favorable to manafort this conduct shows little respect for this court and a penchant for skirting if not breaking rules manaforts attorney kevin downing on thursday denied that his client had violated the gag order saying an article published in a ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the united states l1n1o72h6 downing acknowledged in a filing on thursday that manafort had helped edit the piece but said it was his clients first amendment right to defend himself he did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on muellers second filing muellers team responded to downings first amendment argument by citing a supreme court case that found that free speech does not disable a district court  from taking steps to protect cases that could be harmed by the creation of a carnival atmosphere in high profile cases a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of muellers investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 us presidential election and possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign russia has denied any meddling and trump has dismissed any suggestions of collusion the charges

"Trump lifts refugee ban, but admissions still plummet, data shows", washington reuters  in late october president donald trump lifted a temporary ban on most refugee admissions a move that should have cleared the way for more people fleeing persecution and violence to come to the united states instead the number of refugees admitted to the country has plummeted in the five weeks after the ban was lifted 40 percent fewer people were allowed in than in the last five weeks it was in place according to a reuters analysis of state department data that plunge has gone almost unnoticed as he lifted the ban trump instituted new rules for tougher vetting of applicants and also effectively halted at least for now the entry of refugees from 11 countries deemed as high risk the latter move has contributed significantly to the precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted the data shows that the trump administrations new restrictions have proven to be a far greater barrier to refugees than even his temporary ban which was limited in scope by the supreme court the state department data shows that the kind of refugees being allowed in has also changed a far smaller portion are muslim when the ban was in place they made up a quarter of all refugees now that it has been lifted they represent just under 10 percent admissions over five weeks is a limited sample from which to draw broad conclusions and resettlement numbers often pick up later in the fiscal year which began in october but the sharp drop has alarmed refugee advocates theyre pretty much shutting the refugee program down without having to say thats what theyre doing said eric schwartz president of refugees international theyve gotten better at using bureaucratic methods and national security arguments to achieve nefarious and unjustifiable objectives trump administration officials say the temporary ban on refugees and the new security procedures that followed served to protect americans from potential terrorist attacks supporters of the administrations move also argue that the refugee program needed reform and that making it more stringent will ultimately strengthen it the program needed to be tightened up said joshua meservey a senior policy analyst at the heritage foundation a conservative think tank who formerly worked in refugee resettlement in africa im all for strengthening the vetting cracking down on the fraud being really intentional on who we select for this because i think it protects the program ultimately when we do that a state department official attributed the drop in refugee admissions to increased vetting reviews aimed at identifying potential threats and a smaller annual refugee quota this year of 45000 the lowest level in decades refugee admissions rarely happen at a steady pace and in many years start out low and increase throughout the year it would be premature to assess the 2018 fiscal years pace at this point the official said speaking on condition of anonymity trump has made controlling immigration a centerpiece of his presidency citing both a desire to protect american jobs and national security during the 2016 presidential campaign he said syrian refugees could be aligned with islamist militants and promised extreme vetting of applicants the white house did not respond to a request for comment after the ban was lifted the new rules imposed included a requirement that refugees provide 10 years of biographical information rather than five years a pause in a program that allows for family reunification and a detailed threat analysis and review of refugees from 11 countries a department of homeland security spokesman said that 90day review began on oct 25 the day after trump lifted the ban officials have said that during the review period refugees from egypt iran iraq libya mali north korea somalia south sudan sudan syria and yemen will be allowed in on a case by case basis but they have also said priority will be given to other applicants for each of the last three years refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of us admissions while nine of the 11 countries are majority muslim it is often their religious minorities including christians and jews who seek asylum in the united states and in practice of the 11 countries only iran iraq somalia south sudan sudan and syria produce refugees who resettle in the united states in meaningful numbers trump administration officials have said the 90day review does not amount to a bar on refugees from the 11 countries but just as the review launched the number of refugees coming from those countries ceased almost entirely in the five weeks before the ban was lifted 587 refugees from the 11 countries were allowed in despite tough eligibility rules according to the reuters review of the state department data in the five weeks after trump lifted the ban just 15 refugees from those countries were allowed in from all countries 1469 refugees were admitted to the united states in the five weeks between oct 25 and nov 28 according to the state department data that was 41 percent lower than during the final five weeks of the ban when nearly 2500 refugees gained entry just 9 percent of refugees admitted to the united states between oct 25 and nov 28 were muslim and 63 percent were christian in the five weeks prior 26 percent were muslim and 55 percent were christian more refugees were allowed in during the period the temporary refugee ban was in place because the supreme court in okaying the ban in june required refugees with bona fide ties to the united states be exempted the new rules have been challenged in court but no rulings have yet been issued each twist in us refugee policy has left alireza a gay iranian refugee living in turkey confused desperate for information and less hopeful he will ever make it to the united states alireza 34 had already been interviewed by us officials and was on track for resettlement when trump issued his first refugee ban in january he declined to share his last name because his family does not know he is gay but he shared documents with reuters on his case to confirm his identity and refugee status when trumps ban was initially blocked by federal courts alireza was able to continue the vetting process and was close to the point of being resettled then came the supreme court ruling reinstating the ban and then the new restrictions replacing the ban as a refugee from one of the 11 countries targeted for additional scrutiny he is once again in limbo alireza questions the national security logic of the new review he and his boyfriend of 13 years fled to turkey in 2014 after facing harassment beatings and extortion in iran human rights groups say that discriminatory laws in iran against sexual minorities put them at risk of harassment and violence in turkey he said they scrape by with unstable parttime work and feel threatened by what they see as a rise in antigay sentiment in turkish society we ourselves have been hurt by the islamist system in iran he said in a recent telephone interview from eskisehir in northwestern turkey why would we

U.S. top court takes up Republican challenge to Maryland electoral district,washington reuters  the us supreme court on friday added a second case to its docket on a contentious issue that could have major consequences for american elections agreeing to decide whether democratic lawmakers in maryland unlawfully drew a congressional district in a way that would prevent a republican candidate from winning the courts agreement to take up an appeal by republican voters in maryland regarding the us house of representatives district came two months after the justices heard arguments in a highprofile challenge by democratic voters to republicandrawn state legislative districts in wisconsin both cases target a practice known as partisan gerrymandering that aims to entrench one party in power and that critics have called a distortion of the democratic process the justices have not yet issued a ruling in the wisconsin case each case presents a different legal theory as to why limits should be placed on partisan gerrymandering and the courts decision to take up a second case on the issue hints that at least some of the nine justices are seriously considering cracking down on it gerrymandering a practice dating back two centuries in american politics involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another legislative districts around the united states are redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes the redistricting in most states is done by the party in power though some states assign the task to independent commissions the supreme court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage in the maryland case the republican voters targeting the democraticdrawn electoral map appealed a 21 ruling in august by a panel of three federal judges sitting in baltimore rejecting their challenge marylands sixth congressional district the focus of the case was previously held by a republican and now is held by democrat john delaney when the supreme court heard arguments in the wisconsin case on oct 3 the justices appeared closely divided with conservative justice anthony kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote the republican challengers in maryland take aim at a single electoral district not the whole state as in the wisconsin case they argue that the district should be struck down because it was drawn by democrats as a form of retaliation on the basis of past party affiliation based on the constitutions guaranteed rights of free association and free speech the challengers in the wisconsin case argued that the republican electoral map violated democratic voters rights to equal protection under the law as well as free speech and association in the wisconsin case the legal argument advanced by the democratic challengers was that an electoral map would be unlawful if the intent was to discriminate against minority party voters the map had a sizable effect in accomplishing that goal and that there was no other justification for the map the theory was based in part on measuring the number of wasted votes in each district cast for a losing candidate and comparing each partys total wasted votes on a statewide basis the results plaintiffs said show whether one partys votes are more likely to be wasted than the other partys which would show evidence of unconstitutional extreme partisan gerrymandering ,politicsNews,8-Dec-17,1

earnings a company makes beyond its borders as a result companies would have fewer incentives to bring previously accumulated foreign profits home quickly because rates are not scheduled to revert higher up to 250 billion in foreign earnings could be repatriated over an indefinite period according to td securities while that could provide some boost to the dollar repatriation will probably not be a significant ongoing factor in the 45 trillion global currency market analysts said it was a oneoff repatriation and mandatory in 2005 so companies took advantage of it and the dollar benefited from it said mark mccormick north american head of fx strategy at td securities in toronto but this tax bill doesnt have that same urgency so far there is no final version of the tax bill legislation passed by the house of representatives would allow companies to bring back foreign profits at a 14 percent repatriation tax rate as opposed to the current 35 percent over eight years the senate bill approved over the weekend puts the rate at 1449 percent neither bill requires companies to convert foreign profits into dollars prospects of a tax break on companies foreign earnings and expectations of wider us budget deficits helped boost the dollar to its highest levels since 2002 soon after trumps presidential victory in november 2016 now that the tax bills have passed both houses of congress dollar bulls have started banging their drums again analysts at unicredit said however they said this attitude is misguided because the vast majority of the earnings that companies will repatriate are probably already in dollardenominated securities in the united states even a significant wave of repatriation might not lift the dollar directly as some of the largest us corporations already hold a lot of cash in dollardenominated assets said shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank in toronto in many cases foreign profits are based in dollars held in accounts at us banks yet are treated as overseas assets on a companys balance sheet as a result they are not recognized as us income and are therefore not subject to us taxes the brookings institution a nonprofit public policy organization based in washington estimates that at the 15 us companies with the largest cash balances abroad 95 percent of foreign profits are held in us dollardenominated cash or equivalents for example microsoft corp noted in its annual report that as of june 30 roughly 92 percent of the cash and shortterm investments held by its foreign units was already invested in us dollar assets despite some skepticism about us repatriation flows some analysts say the dollar could get a shortterm boost immediately after tax reform is passed youre going to hear this giant sucking sound as money is heading home very quickly said david woo head of global rates and currencies research at bank of america merrill lynch yet he does not expect a dollar rally to continue beyond the second quarter of 2018 partly due to concerns about the tax plans impact on the us fiscal deficit over the long term the dollar will probably continue to slide said brian jacobsen multiasset strategist at wells fargo asset management the effects of the tax bill are already largely priced into the currency market leaving little unexpected demand over the following 12 months he said we are positioning client portfolios for a little more dollar weakness he said not strength ,politicsNews,8-Dec-17,1
Aide tries to refocus tax debate after Trump's corporate rate remark,washington reuters  president donald trumps weekend remark about a scaledback tax cut for corporations sparked behindthescenes debate in the us congress with a white house aide trying on thursday to minimize the impact of the presidents comment two rival tax bills passed separately by the senate and the house of representatives propose cutting the us corporate tax rate to 20 percent but they differ in other areas that republicans are trying to merge into final legislation speaking to reporters after the senate approved its tax bill on saturday trump said the corporate tax rate in the final legislation expected soon from lawmakers could be 22 percent  it could also be 20 percent the remark whetted the interest of some republicans who see a slight upward bump in the proposed corporate tax rate as capturing needed federal revenue that would help solve other problems with the legislation according to lobbyists the 20 percent rate ought to be our goal said house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady who is expected to head a bicameral housesenate negotiating committee my view is the president is giving us flexibility in that area if its needed no decisions been made on if thats needed the texas republican told reporters but white house legislative affairs director marc short told reuters on thursday that trump was not voicing support for a higher proposed corporate rate instead he may have been only expressing views conveyed to him by republican senators i think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them but that  wasnt intended to signal this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate short said we believe that 20 percent is the right number  20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going he said in an interview trump and his republican allies have plenty riding on what happens over the next few weeks a sweeping us tax overhaul which has not been achieved since 1986 would give republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017 after their failure to overturn former president barack obamas healthcare law without a win republicans fear they could lose their control of the house and senate in the 2018 congressional elections but it may be too late to avoid confusion over priorities as the tax debate moves forward in congress lobbyists said many perceive that trump and his advisers would accept a corporate rate higher than 20 percent white house economic adviser kevin hassett said on thursday that a 22 percent corporate rate would not undermine the economic boost that republicans say tax cuts will create analysts say the corporate income tax rate could be a ready source of revenue for lawmakers as they move toward a final bill that can lose no more than 15 trillion in revenue over the next decade under senate rules republicans are considering a more costly deduction for state and local taxes than the 10000 property tax deduction contained in the house and senate bills one version would allow taxpayers to choose a 10000 deduction for either property or income taxes house lawmakers also want to adopt the house bills repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax which would cost about 40 billion in revenue over a decade according to the joint committee on taxation senate retained the tax a house limit on the amount of debt interest payments that businesses can deduct from their income would also cost about 136 billion more than the senate version the jct said analysts say a one percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about 100 billion in revenues over a decade ,politicsNews,8-Dec-17,1

from party colleagues said on the senate floor he would leave in a few weeks although he denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others the 66yearold former comedian from minnesota had been seen as a rising star in the democratic party i know in my heart that nothing ive done as a senator  nothing  has brought dishonor on this institution he said nevertheless today i am announcing that in the coming weeks i will be resigning as a member of the united states senate hours later franks announced his resignation after two former staff members complained about discussions he had with them about his efforts to find a surrogate mother i deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress said franks who was first elected to his arizona congressional seat in 2002 and is an outspoken opponent of abortion franks said in a statement that he and his wife have long struggled with infertility the developments came with congress already held in low regard by voters according to a reutersipsos poll only 20 percent approved of the way congress was handling its job with 70 percent disapproving in recent weeks charges of sexual misconduct have taken down prominent people in the worlds of entertainment media and politics it is somewhat rare for members of the senate or house of representatives to resign from office but

said on thursday striking a tone of defiance he also sought to contrast himself with two prominent republicans  president donald trump and senate candidate roy moore i of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that i am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the senate with the full support of his party he said trump was heard bragging about kissing and forcibly touching women in a 2005 videotape that surfaced last year as he was running for

they were teenagers and moore was in his early 30s moore 70 has denied the accusations which reuters has not independently verified trump has backed moore but senate republicans have been cooler toward his candidacy in pressing franken to step aside democrats have tried to capture the moral high ground and draw a distinction between their party and republicans in every workplace in america including the us senate we must confront the challenges of harassment and misconduct said amy klobuchar frankens fellow democratic senator from minnesota similarly house republican speaker paul ryan said on thursday he had told franks that he should resign a special election will be scheduled to determine a replacement for franks while a democrat will be appointed initially to replace franken his departure could complicate the partys efforts to maintain or build on the 46 senate seats they hold two independent senators also vote with the democrats republicans are defending eight seats in the congressional elections in november 2018 but democrats will be defending 26 if minnesota holds a special election for frankens seat the election to fill frankens seat could be close when he ran in

EU refugee court ruling triggers new east-west feuding,luxembourgbrussels reuters  the eu s highest court ruled on wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach europe dismissing complaints by slovakia and hungary and reigniting an eastwest row that has shaken the union s cohesion the mediterranean migrant crisis which prompted mandatory quotas in 2015 for relocating asylum seekers from greece and italy has receded easing immediate pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders who are making electoral capital from lambasting the eu while benefiting from brussels subsidies but defiant rejection from some excommunist states that the eu accuses of slipping on democratic standards  hungary called the judgment a political rape of eu law  indicated no letup in tensions that are testing the union s internal cooperation in germany where chancellor angela merkel is fighting for reelection against opponents who criticize her for taking in over a million migrants at the height of the drama the interior minister threatened legal action against countries which fail to take in their allotted share of syrian and other refugees but hungary where outspoken prime minister viktor orban has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his reelection campaign for next year branded the european court of justice ruling appalling and irresponsible  this decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of europe foreign minister peter szijjarto said politics has raped european law and values italy now the main destination for migrants taking to the sea following measures to block the route from turkey to greece and from greece northward has been prominent in calling for the wealthier western states to cut eu subsidies to poor neighbors which do not show solidarity in taking in migrants european commission president jeanclaude juncker has echoed that threat warning orban solidarity is not a oneway street  but the eu executive is also anxious to calm tensions ahead of negotiations on a new sevenyear eu budget that will be all the harder because of a hole left by britain s imminent departure the commission said on wednesday it may seek fines at the ecj within weeks for hungary poland and the czech republic if they do not start or resume taking people from the south poland and hungary which argue muslim immigration is a threat to their national security and stability have in two years taken in none of their respective quotas of about 6200 and 1300 people however the executive which is separately considering trying to suspend eastern heavyweight poland for undermining the independence of its judiciary stressed it wanted solutions that would unite the 28nation bloc slovakia s prime minister said he still rejected quotas but was willing to help in other ways and as the union digests a brexit vote last year that was partly driven by concern over migration many states that backed the quota system in 2015 and are increasingly exasperated by polish and hungarian hostility to brussels are also reluctant to force through new policies that may bolster eurosceptics across europe who say the eu is trampling on national sovereignty if we push it through above their heads they will use it in their antieu propaganda at home one eu diplomat said while noting that with the migration crisis dropping out of the headlines all sides might find a way to resolve the issue the commission is working on reforms to the socalled dublin rules under which people arriving in the eu must stay to claim asylum in the first country they reach a mechanism to help the likes of greece and italy in emergencies has proved elusive however governments may find it easier to negotiate now that the migration is not quite so prominent in local politics the luxembourgbased ecj dismissed in their entirety the arguments advanced by hungary and slovakia with backing from poland and endorsed the commission s solution which eventually ordered states to take in nearly 100000 syrians and others the mechanism actually contributes to enabling greece and italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate the court said in statement difficulties in identifying candidates for relocation  and a reluctance of refugees to settle other than in the wealthier west of europe  saw fewer than 30000 people relocated in two years but the commission noted an acceleration in the program this year and said it would continue to move people northward among the gravest problems the migration crisis caused was member states reimposing controls on internal eu frontiers that had jeopardized one of the union s most cherished achievements and for a time appeared to threaten to disrupt internal traffic eu migration commissioner dimitris avramopoulos said special exemptions that have allowed the likes of germany austria denmark and sweden to control their borders with eu neighbors should now end when they expire in two months time ,worldnews,5-Sep-17,1

Hong Kong's vanishing archives and the battle to preserve history,hong kong reuters  for anyone digging into hong kong s history the official archives might not be the place to look the office of the chief executive hong kong s leader failed to hand over any official records at all for eight of the 20 years since it came under chinese rule in 1997 according to the government department that manages the archives the security bureau only did it for 10 researchers say the problem is that hong kong under roughly 150 years of british colonial rule and the first 20 years of chinese rule has never had a law regulating how government records should be kept or destroyed as a result the document retention that researchers see as necessary for keeping a record of the past has been somewhat spotty within hong kong under british rule the archiving of documents in hong kong was also lax in 1994 and 1995 for example the government house gave nothing to the archives but thanks to a constant flow of correspondence between the colonial government and london britain would have stored a copy of most official records according to researchers after the handover of hong kong to china in 1997 that backup mechanism disappeared leading to concerns that fragments of hong kong s history might slip away for good unlike hong kong china has a set of archive laws under which officials failing to file records can face administrative sanctions or face charges if the case constitutes a crime but researchers say that for any hong kongrelated documents kept by china access would be difficult simon chu the former head of the government records service who has been advocating for an archives law said that prior to 1997 researchers could count on finding records in britain even if they were lost in hong kong after 1997 you don t have this kind of luxury he said connie lo a documentary director digging into the 1967 communistled riots in hong kong found almost nothing on the subject in the government archives she was however able to find material in britain s national archives for her film vanished archives which premiered in hong kong this year fears over record retention were highlighted last year when the government of former chief executive leung chunying said it had kept no records of informal meetings with local groups over a controversial land development project hong kong s current leader carrie lam has said she places great importance on the integrity of government records and that she supports passing an archives law she said she would pursue a law after receiving a report from the law reform commission which is studying the issue the commission however has been considering the issue for four years and only expects to start consultations on the subject next year activists like chu are anxious that records of sensitive information such as government decisions during the 2014 prodemocracy street protests could be destroyed with impunity i m very pessimistic about that chu said one former senior government official speaking on condition of anonymity also admitted to throwing out some documents in order to protect a former top official he declined to say what the documents contained but he suggested the practice might be widespread in the civil service for some of the most sensitive issues there would not even be a record he said the government records service said it received 25 reports of unauthorized destruction of records in the past six years and disciplinary actions were taken against four officers in four cases ,worldnews,6-Sep-17,1

month s election and who is barred from holding public office once his term expires nevertheless he urged venezuelans to vote in the elections if you abstain then it s more difficult to bring about the political change that all venezuelans want capriles told reporters capriles has called his own barring from office  because of alleged irregularities in managing public funds  a socialist party move to sideline him governorships provide little in the way of a platform to directly challenge maduro but they are coveted by politicians because they offer launching pads for political careers and the possibility to channel state resources toward political allies the opposition s participation in next month s poll ensures it will have witnesses at voting stations and at the election council headquarters opposition coalition leaders say that should allow them to quickly identify any attempt to alter results however some who spent months on the streets with the encouragement of opposition leaders especially young members of a selfstyled resistance movement feel betrayed they say turning attention so quickly to the election legitimizes what they view as maduro s authoritarianism and insults the memory of slain protesters they also see a contradiction with the opposition s decision to boycott july s vote for the constituent assembly maduro pushed for the creation of the assembly which is meant to rewrite the constitution but which has no formal check on its powers saying it would restore stability to a country in turmoil over the widespread antigovernment protests it has broadly supplanted the congress which the opposition won control of in a 2015 landslide vote small opposition party vente venezuela and its founder maria corina machado who has a high profile in the media but limited influence broke with the opposition s democratic unity coalition over its decision to join next month s vote the main opposition parties have nominated candidates and opinion polls show that in a free and fair vote they would likely take a majority compared to just three governorships they won in 2012 but the socialist partycontrolled constituent assembly may bar some of them from running or from holding office if they win last week the assembly said it would seek the prosecution of opposition leaders for treason for attempting to block international financing for maduro s government and for allegedly seeking a military intervention against him government leaders say the end of the protests is evidence the constituent assembly has brought peace to the country they add that the opposition s decision to register candidates is a sign they believe in the electoral system despite their complaints of fraud the constituent assembly has calmed the country said assembly president delcy rodriguez as soon as it was inaugurated venezuela returned to tranquility maduro says the country is a victim of an economic war by the opposition and insists the assembly is a symbol of venezuela s vibrant democracy the opposition took to the streets in late march to protest a supreme court ruling that briefly allowed it to assume the powers of congress and maintained near daily rallies until the end of july by then street mobilizations were in decline and what had initially been massive marches steadily gave way to violent clashes between security forces and small groups of hooded demonstrators throwing rocks and at times vandalizing property recent opposition rallies have attracted only a few hundred people us president donald trump has imposed sanctions on top ruling socialist party officials in some cases for their participation in the constituent assembly while the european union and most latin american nations condemned the body maduro has acquired the reputation as a dictator around the world said opposition leader freddy guevara in an interview in august broadcast on the internet adding that street protests were crucial in shifting public opinion

"Defying warnings, residents refuse to leave Mumbai's crumbling buildings",mumbai reuters  on a sunny morning last week in mumbai after two days of incessant monsoon rain mohammad altaf had come out of his home for a cigarette when he heard a terrifying crash followed by a huge swirl of dust the sixstorey husainee building where he had lived for the last month had collapsed trapping nearly 50 people thirtyfour of them were killed including a newborn baby it was shocking i had come down for a smoke and within two minutes the building was no more said altaf who says he was unaware the apartment block was declared unsafe by housing authorities in india s financial hub six years ago across the teeming city of 20 million people thousands of families live in crumbling buildings that have been officially declared uninhabitable  and most of them know it housing officials say they cannot be forced out because of lax laws this year the city s municipal corporation classified 791 buildings as beyond repair and too dangerous to live in but close to 500 of these continue to be occupied a municipal authority official said although regulations vary from country to country and also from state to state authorities in most places have more powers to order evacuations altaf in his midthirties is a bachelor and was living with two coworkers in the apartment in the bhendi bazar locality one of the oldest in the metropolis his two flatmates survived with minor knee and shoulder injuries after jumping out of their apartment on the third floor police say they have yet to determine the cause of the collapse which came after days of intense rain the 117yearold apartment block in bhendi bazar a packed neighborhood of narrow streets shops and tenements was declared unsafe in 2011 by the regulator the maharashtra housing and area development authority mhada yet it continued to house altaf and his flatmates along with five other families a sweet shop warehouse and even a nursery on the first floor the owner of the building hakimmudin bootwala said seven families moved out by 2014 but other tenants refused despite his urging one of them had sublet the apartment to altaf and his colleagues the people were my friends and neighbors first and tenants later said the 73yearold i sincerely advised them to move out the building had lots of problems leakages the roof was fine but the walls had become really weak and porous an official at mhada said there was a law to force residents to evacuate dangerous buildings but enforcing it was impossible because of loopholes and legal challenges for instance evicting children and senior citizens could cause trouble said the housing official who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the press we cut water and electricity supply of buildings that are identified as dangerous for living but people manage to get water and electricity from nearby buildings said the official mhada which does a routine check of buildings that are older than 30 years has identified more than 14000 buildings in the city that need repair according to its latest list nine thousand of these home to nearly 250000 families need to be redeveloped the housing official said adding that the other 5000 were relatively safe due to regular maintenance work done by landowners in consultation with the housing body once regulators decide a building needs to redeveloped they have to appoint a developer to renovate or rebuild the structure in the case of public housing or order private owners to hire one the developer in turn must offer residents alternative accommodation until the work is completed according to state law in mumbai but residents often complain the housing they are offered is too small shabby or too far away seventy percent of tenants of both privately and publiclyowned buildings must agree to redevelop their building according to state rules or no redevelopment work can commence building owners say residents are often unrealistic refusing to leave even if the alternative housing is adequate some worry they could lose their tenancy if they move the mhada official said the agency does everything it can to get residents and developers to clinch an agreement but that the process often gets mired in legal challenges the problems of the husainee building were typical a neighborhood body the saifee burhani upliftment trust had been selected by its owner in 2009 to redevelop the building along with other buildings in the neighborhood even before the husainee had been declared unsafe by mhada a trust official told reuters it offered alternative housing to the residents in a place around 25 km 15 miles from the building the official said the trust repeated the offer in 2011 after mhada declared the building unsafe a reuters team visited the complex where the husainee families who had agreed to move had been relocated a gated highrise complex with guards and a playground for kids residents said they were happy with their new apartments although they complained about the distance to work but other husainee families refused to move mhada officials said the trust was in charge of ensuring relocation and redevelopment and mhada could not force the husainee families to leave the trust has said it has repeatedly tried to evict families from husainee but some residents refused to move this incident should be a wakeup call for the city and a policy needs to be actioned to evict noncooperating tenants who continue to live in dilapidated buildings the trust said in a written reply to reuters queries building owner bootwala says the residents who refused to leave argued they did not want to upend their lives by moving to a new neighborhood also they did not know how long it would take to renovate the building reuters was unable to talk to other residents from husainee but neighbors in bhendi bazar told similar stories despite knowing their buildings were unsafe many of them did not want to leave a man in his 50s in the neighborhood who refused to give his name said he was living in a more than 100year old building that had been deemed unsafe the developer offered him temporary housing 13 km 8 miles away but he said that was too far i spent my entire life here i know every lane in this area the man said my children s college my

North Korea's nuclear scientists take center stage with H-bomb test,seoul reuters  decorated by pyongyang but blacklisted abroad two scientists pictured with north korea s leader ahead of sunday s nuclear test play vital roles in the reclusive country s pursuit of a powerful weapon capable of striking the united states experts say north korea s sixth nuclear test on sunday showed the country has either developed a hydrogen bomb  which has vastly more destructive power than atomic bombs  or was very getting close to obtaining one photos released by the official kcna news agency just hours before the test showed two men standing alongside leader kim jong un as he inspected a new peanutshaped warhead ri hong sop head of north korea s nuclear weapons institute and hong sung mu deputy director of the ruling workers party of korea s munitions industry department several north korea leadership experts say they are part of a cadre of weapons experts at the frontline of the young leader s stated ambition developing an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm that can carry a nuclear weapon to the united states compared to his father kim jong il and grandfather kim il sung who preferred small working groups and middle managers to deal with weapons programs the 33yearold leader has been more personally involved with these scientists the experts say citing his frequent appearances with the technocrats at state events weapons tests and field inspections it appears that hong is spearheading the nuclear development program as a senior party official and ri is in charge of nuclear tests such as hydrogen bombs on a working level said yang moojin professor at the university of north korean studies in seoul who monitors the country s hierarchy and leadership reuters could not independently confirm the precise role of the two men the north korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in pyongyang for comment by email fax or phone the north korean mission to the united nations was not immediately available for comment the two scientists have become increasingly high profile as pyongyang s weapons programs have advanced at a rapid pace under kim s leadership a reuters review of north korean state media showed in january 2016 hong and ri were the first and second in line to receive medals personally awarded by kim at a ceremony to mark the country s fourth nuclear test state tv footage showed two months later they accompanied a smiling kim inspecting a silvercolored sphere which the north said was a miniaturized warhead capable of being fitted to an icbm the wider group of weapons technocrats includes a trio of rocket scientists who have accompanied kim on several crucial missile launches including two july icbm test launches that showed much of the us mainland was now within range experts say kim s handson approach may have contributed to faster development of its nuclear weapons and missiles while allowing the scientists to develop personal links to the leader kim jong un goes out of his way to show they have a personal closeness to him said michael madden an expert on the north korean leadership pointing to kim s frequent appearances with cadres engaged with its weapons program it s likely linked to the fact that the scientists are making huge accomplishments in this area and thus making big accomplishments for kim jong un as leader of north korea like the three rocket scientists ri and hong have been blacklisted in recent years by the united nations the united states or south korea for their roles in north korea s weapons programs the united nations blacklisted ri in 2009 citing his involvement in the production of weaponsgrade plutonium  while an expert un panel this year noted

center for international security and cooperation hecker did not immediately respond to requests for comment about ri or the north korean nuclear program in a statement carried by kcna hours before

a colleague reacted to news events like presidential debates in ways that could appear antitrumpabc news reported back in august that strzok had left the investigation but said at the time it s unclear why strzok stepped away from mueller s team of nearly two dozen lawyers investigators and administrative staffers and the washington post s report today on strzok contains some rather well

democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them it s really pitiful that after so many months that all the democrats have is this lie the electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters would you want california and new york deciding our elections that s what would happen without the electoral college we bet

constitution posted by fox  friends on friday october 27 2017 the electoral college is not a creation of the constitution perez said during a lecture at indiana university law school it doesn t have to be there the electoral college a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the founding fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states is clearly laid out in article ii of the constitution each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress perez has previously stated that president donald trump didn t win last november s election because hillary clinton won the popular votefollowing his comment perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a national popular vote compact in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote there s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says we will allocate our vote our electoral votes to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same perez said i m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was maryland the main supporters of the plan put forward by perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the constitution not an argument that the system doesn t existthe comment from perez came during a lecture honoring former indiana democratic sen birch bayh who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine via wfbour previous report on the electoral collegeplease share this with the clueless left if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote small and rural states would become irrelevant and campaigns would spend their time in large populous districts the electoral college remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the constitution empowered it to select presidents though occasionally maligned this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the american peoplethe founding fathers created the electoral college after much debate and compromise but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections 1824 1876 1888 and 2000some see the electoral college as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the united states others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large onesevery four years around election time there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct national popular votethe founders collegeas one of the heritage foundations legal experts hans von spakovsky noted in a paper on the electoral college in creating the basic architecture of the american government the founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule some elements of the electoral college such as the indirect vote through intermediaries were hotly debated at the 1787 constitutional convention it was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal traitor or similar kind of heinous person the founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the american system but they feared a kind of pure unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the pastthe product of the founders compromise has been well balanced and enduring and we would be wise to leave it intactalexander hamilton defended the electoral college in federalist 68 he argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president but it was also desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability and that an intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes as students of ancient history the founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people the electoral college was a compromise neither fully democratic nor aristocraticthe constitution stateseach state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congressin addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule the founding fathers attempted to create a federalist system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities america s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states not just the american people as an undifferentiated massthe total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the district of columbia included after the passage of the 23rd amendment adds up to 538 the winner must receive a majority or 270 of these votes to become presidentthe system empowers states especially smaller ones because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers farmers in iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in new york a more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into accountthe states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors in the early days of the republic most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors rather than the people but over time the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead every state has opted for popular election at least since the civil warcalls to abolishmodern opponents of the electoral college argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution criticizing both the intermediary electors and the statebystate system of votingcalls to fundamentally change the electoral college reached a peak after republican george w bush defeated democrat al gore in the tightly contested 2000 election gore narrowly won the national popular vote and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the supreme court stepping in was unfairone organization national popular vote has worked toward eliminating the electoral college through an amendment to the constitution or a state compact national popular vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in swing states rather than campaigning for votes across the entire countrythis plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support but heritage s von spakovsky has called it bad policy based on mistaken assumptions swing states he wrote can change from election to election and many states that are today considered to be reliably blue or red in the presidential race were recently unpredictable many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national votebut this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers swing states change over time and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swingstate unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political mapadditionally if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote small and rural states would become irrelevant and campaigns would spend their time in large populous districtsfinally are the democrats proud of this disgusting man who curses and liesread more daily signal,Government

ILLEGAL ALIENS Jump Over Border Fence as MSNBC Reports On Border Wall Construction [Video],oh the irony leftleaning msnbc aired a segment about president trump s proposed border wall which ultimately proved the usmexico border needs a bigger wallhow high should we go the trump administration has approved the construction of eight prototypes of the border wall these prototypes are nearing completion as the administration s deadline approaches the prototypes have several guidelines they must satisfy for instance concrete walls have to be 30 ft tall while walls made from alternate materials have to be 18 to 30 ft talljumping the fence msnbc reporter jacob soboroff went to preview the prototypes that are being built between two existing border fences along the usmexico border during the segment soboroff was interviewing border patrol agent roy villareal when several migrants were caught on camera jumping the existing fence into the united stateseveryday border enforcement  open borders a small group of three people just jumped over in the middle of the day soboroff noted so can you explain to me what s going on this is the reality of everyday border enforcement the united states is the draw for people with dire situations where they are at villareal said we are going to continue to witness this it plays out on a regular basis for us soboroff went to the mexican side of the border and showed how easy it was to cross the border under current conditionsthis is outrageous can you imagine how easy it s been for terrorists to crosswe just reported on a terrorist who made his way to canada via mexico and the us the democrats are fighting against closing our border with mexico at every step of the way they want open borders it s that simple if you vote for democrats then you re voting for open borders they have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to america one of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from mexico looking for a job or better life the truth is that our open border has become a global magnet for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons one of the reasons is terrorism the case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to america and canadathe somali terrorist who stabbed a canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the united states through the mexican border and was released by obama s department of homeland security dhs allowing him to continue his journey north the isis operative abdulahi hasan sharif was ordered deported an immigration and customs enforcement ice spokeswoman told various media outlets recently but was released on an order of supervision and the feds never saw him againsharif entered the us in 2011 through the san ysidro port of entry in california without documentation and was briefly held at the otay mesa detention center in san diego a local newspaper reported a year later he crossed the border into canada and settled in edmonton after being granted refugee status on september 30 he slammed into an edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife after fleeing the scene sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians canadian authorities found an isis flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon two years ago canadian authorities investigated the 30yearold terrorist for espousing extremist views it s disturbing that sharif s northbound trek took him through the usmexico borderas part of an ongoing investigation into cartels corruption and terrorism judicial watch has for years reported that islamic extremists are entering the country through mexico and that isis is operating in border towns just miles from american cities judicial watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narcoterror ring with strong ties to isis and connections running from el paso to chicago to new york city two of the fbi s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to mexico less than a year later judicial watch reported that isis is operating in a mexican border town just eight miles from el paso the result of islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as coyotes when judicial watch reported that mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small texas rural town federal authorities publicly denied the story was true never the less highlevel sources on both sides of the border confirmed to judicial watch that foreigners classified as special interest aliens sia were being transported to stash areas in acala a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from el paso on a state road highway 20 once in the us the sias waited for pickup in the area s sand hills just across highway 20 at the time a texas department of public safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern borderlast year a highranking dhs official told judicial watch that mexican drug traffickers help islamic terrorists stationed in mexico cross into the united states to explore targets for future attacks among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a kuwaiti named shaykh mahmood omar khabir an isis operative who lives in the mexican state of chihuahua not far from el paso khabir trained hundreds of al qaeda fighters in pakistan afghanistan and yemen and has lived in mexico for more than a year according to information provided by judicial watch s government source now khabir trains thousands of men mostly syrians and yemenis to fight in an isis base situated in the mexicous border region near ciudad ju rez the intelligence gathered by judicial watch s source reveals staking out us targets is not difficult and khabir actually bragged in an italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he could get in with a handful of men and kill thousands of people in texas or in arizona in the space of a few hours in the same article mexico s top diplomat foreign affairs secretary claudia ruiz said this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the united states while much of the american mainstream media ignores that sharif made it to canada via the usmexico border it s hardly surprising considering islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years referring to the recent canadian attack a thinktank dedicated to investigating the operations funding activities and front groups of islamic extremists worldwide writes fears about a terrorist using the usmexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized via judicial watch,Government News,23-Oct-17,0

first thing today in the hill and it s a doozy will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt antiamerican selfserving and lying players not providing information on a corruption scheme before the russian uranium deal was approved by us regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine us national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them the russian efforts to manipulate our american political enterprise is breathtaking former house intelligence chair mike rogers rmithe hill before the obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving moscow control of a large swath of american uranium the fbi had gathered substantial evidence that russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery kickbacks extortion and money laundering designed to grow vladimir putin s atomic energy business inside the united states according to government documents and interviewsfederal agents used a confidential us witness working inside the russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed moscow had compromised an american uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act fbi and court documents showthey also obtained an eyewitness account backed by documents indicating russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the us designed to benefit former president bill clinton s charitable foundation during the time secretary of state hillary clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to moscow sources told the hillthe racketeering scheme was conducted with the consent of higher level officials in russia who shared the proceeds from the kickbacks one agent declared in an affidavit years laterrather than bring immediate charges in 2010 however the department of justice doj continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years essentially leaving the american public and congress in the dark about russian nuclear corruption on us soil during a period when the obama administration made two major decisions benefitting putin s commercial nuclear ambitionsthe first decision occurred in october 2010 when the state department and government agencies on the committee on foreign investment in the united states unanimously approved the partial sale of canadian mining company uranium one to the russian nuclear giant rosatom giving moscow control of more than 20 percent of america s uranium supplywhen this sale was used by trump on the campaign trail last year hillary clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the state department official who handled it said she never intervened on any committee on foreign investment in the united states matter in 2011 the administration gave approval for rosatom s tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to us nuclear power plants in a partnership with the united states enrichment corp before then tenex had been limited to selling us nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s megatons to megawatts peace program the russians were compromising american contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats all of which raised legitimate national security concerns and none of that evidence got aired before the obama administration made those decisions a person who worked on the case told the hill speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by us or russian officialsthe obama administration s decision to approve rosatom s purchase of uranium one has been a source of political controversy since 2015that s when conservative author peter schweitzer and the new york times documented how bill clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while hillary clinton presided on the committee on foreign investment in the united statesthe obama administration and the clintons defended their actions at the time insisting there was no evidence that any russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the uranium one dealbut fbi energy department and court documents reviewed by the hill show the fbi in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that vadim mikerin the main russian overseeing putin s nuclear expansion inside the united states was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009thenattorney general eric holder was among the obama administration officials joining hillary clinton on the committee on foreign investment in the united states at the time the uranium one deal was approved multiple current and former government officials told the hill they did not know whether the fbi or doj ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncoveredspokesmen for holder and clinton did not return calls seeking comment the justice department also didn t commentmikerin was a director of rosatom s tenex in moscow since the early 2000s where he oversaw rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the united states under the megatons to megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries in 2010 mikerin was dispatched to the us on a work visa approved by the obama administration to open rosatom s new american arm called tenambetween 2009 and january 2012 mikerin did knowingly and willfully combine conspire confederate and agree with other persons to obstruct delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity enriched uranium in commerce by extortion a november 2014 indictment statedhis illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness an american businessman who began making kickback payments at mikerin s direction and with the permission of the fbi the first kickback payment recorded by the fbi through its informant was dated nov 27 2009 the records show the investigation was ultimately supervised by thenus attorney rod rosenstein an obama appointee who now serves as president trump s deputy attorney general and thenassistant fbi director andrew mccabe now the deputy fbi director under trump justice department documents showon august 6 2017 the washington times questioned deputy attorney general rod rosenstein s fishing expedition aimed at digging up dirt on president trump in his investigation in the trumprussia investigation the special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the department of justice and we don t engage in fishing expeditions mr rosenstein said on fox news sunday in his first sunday show interview mr rosenstein added that special counsel robert mueller understands and i understand the specific scope of the investigation and so it s not a fishing expedition mr rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into mr trump s finances unrelated to possible russian interference in last year s electionmr rosenstein played down the reports that s not anything that i ve said that s not anything director mueller has said we don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible but still unproven collusion between russia and donald trump s campaign during the 2016

terry mcauliffe at a time when mcauliffe was reportedly under investigation by the fbithe connections to the current russia case are many the mikerin probe began in 2009 when robert mueller now the special counsel in charge of the trump case was still fbi director and it ended in late 2015 under the direction of thenfbi director james comey who trump fired earlier this yearbringing down a major russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the us and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s capbut the justice department and fbi took little credit in 2014 when mikerin the russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and chargedthe only public statement occurred an entire year later when the justice department put out a littlenoticed press release in august 2015 just days before labor day the release noted that the various defendants had reached plea dealsthe lack of fanfare left many key players in washington with no inkling that a major russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncoveredon dec 15 2015 the justice department put out a release stating that mikerin a former russian official residing in maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison and ordered to forfeit more than 21 millionronald hosko who served as the assistant fbi director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway told the hill he did not recall ever being briefed about mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged i had no idea this case was being conducted a surprised hosko said in an

technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solvebut each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanityauthority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values the systems and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since world war iiinternational criminal networks traffic drugs weapons people force dislocation and mass migration threaten our borders and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizensto put it simply we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril it is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepairwe have it in our power should we so choose to lift millions from poverty to help our citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence hatred and fearthis institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future it was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty preserve their security and promote their prosperityit was in the same period exactly 70 years ago that the united states developed the marshall plan to help restore europe those three beautiful pillars they re pillars of peace sovereignty security and prosperitythe marshall plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong independent and free as president truman said in his message to congress at that time our support of european recovery is in full accord with our support of the united nations the success of the united nations depends upon the independent strength of its members to overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future we must begin with the wisdom of the past our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security prosperity and peace for themselves and for the worldwe do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures traditions or even systems of government but we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation this is the beautiful vision of this institution and this is foundation for cooperation and successstrong sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values different cultures and different dreams not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respectstrong sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny and strong sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by godin america we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch this week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example we are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved constitution the oldest constitution still in use in the world todaythis timeless document has been the foundation of peace prosperity and freedom for the americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature human dignity and the rule of lawthe greatest in the united states constitution is its first three beautiful words they are we the people generations of americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words the promise of our country and of our great history in america the people govern the people rule and the people are sovereign i was elected not to take power but to give power to the american people where it belongsin foreign affairs we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty our government s first duty is to its people to our citizens to serve their needs to ensure their safety to preserve their rights and to defend their valuesas president of the united states i will always put america first just like you as the leaders of your countries will always and should always put your countries first applauseall responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens and the nationstate remains the best vehicle for elevating the human conditionbut making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all peoplethe united states will forever be a great friend to the world and especially to its allies but we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a onesided deal where the united states gets nothing in return as long as i hold this office i will defend america s interests above all elsebut in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign prosperous and secureamerica does more than speak for the values expressed in the united nations charter our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall america s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies from the beaches of europe to the deserts of the middle east to the jungles of asiait is an eternal credit to the american character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others instead we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty security and prosperity for allfor the diverse nations of the world this is our hope we want harmony and friendship not conflict and strife we are guided by outcomes not ideology we have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals interests and valuesthat realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room it is a question we cannot escape or avoid we will slide down the path of complacency numb to the challenges threats and even wars that we face or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrowif we desire to lift up our citizens if we aspire to the approval of history then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent we must protect our nations their interests and their futures we must reject threats to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow and just as the founders of this body intended we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos turmoil and terrorthe scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based they respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countriesif the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become bystanders to history the forces of destruction only gather power and

ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human lifeit is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict no nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missilesthe united states has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime the united states is ready willing and able but hopefully this will not be necessary that s what the united nations is all about that s what the united nations is for let s see how they doit is time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future the united nations security council recently held two unanimous 150 votes adopting hardhitting resolutions against north korea and i want to thank china and russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions along with all of the other members of the security council thank you to all involvedbut we must do much more it is time for all nations to work together to isolate the kim regime until it ceases its hostile behaviorwe face this decision not only in north korea it is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime one that speaks openly of mass murder vowing death to america destruction to israel and ruin for many leaders and nations in this roomthe iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy it has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence bloodshed and chaos the longestsuffering victims of iran s leaders are in fact its own peoplerather than use its resources to improve iranian lives its oil profits go to fund hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent muslims and attack their peaceful arab and israeli neighbors this wealth which rightly belongs to iran s people also goes to shore up bashar alassad s dictatorship fuel yemen s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire middle eastwe cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program applause the iran deal was one of the worst and most onesided transactions the united states has ever entered into frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the united states and i don t think you ve heard the last of it believe meit is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction it is time for the regime to free all americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained and above all iran s government must stop supporting terrorists begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighborsthe entire world understands that the good people of iran want change and other than the vast military power of the united states that iran s people are what their leaders fear the most this is what causes the regime to restrict internet access tear down satellite dishes shoot unarmed student protestors and imprison political reformersoppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice will they continue down the path of poverty bloodshed and terror or will the iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization culture and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once againthe iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financingin saudi arabia early last year i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 arab and muslim nations we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires themwe will stop radical islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire worldwe must deny the terrorists safe haven transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology we must drive them out of our nations it is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al qaeda hezbollah the taliban and others that slaughter innocent peoplethe united states and our allies are working together throughout the middle east to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our peoplelast month i announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in afghanistan from now on our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politiciansi have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the taliban and other terrorist groups in syria and iraq we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of isis in fact our country has achieved more against isis in the last eight months than it has in many many years combinedwe seek the deescalation of the syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people the actions of the criminal regime of bashar alassad including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens even innocent children shock the conscience of every decent person no society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread that is why the united states carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attackwe appreciate the efforts of united nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from isis and we especially thank jordan turkey and lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the syrian conflictthe united states is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort we seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding processfor the cost of resettling one refugee in the united states we can assist more than 10 in their home region out of the goodness of our hearts we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible this is the safe responsible and humanitarian approachfor decades the united states has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere we have learned that over the long term uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countriesfor the sending countries it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reformsfor the receiving countries the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by lowincome citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and governmenti want to salute the work of the united nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes the united nations and african union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in africa the united states continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance including famine prevention and relief in south sudan somalia and northern nigeria and yemenwe have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like pepfar which funds aids relief the president s malaria initiative the global health security agenda the global fund to end modern slavery and the women entrepreneurs finance initiative part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globewe also thank applause we also thank the secretary general for recognizing that the united nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty security and prosperity too often the focus of this organization has not been on results but on bureaucracy and processin some cases states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them for example it is a massive source of embarrassment to the united nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the un human rights councilthe united states is one out of 193 countries in the united nations and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more in fact we pay far more than anybody realizes the united states bears an unfair cost burden but to be fair if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals especially the goal of peace this investment would easily be well worth itmajor portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell but the powerful people in this room under the guidance and auspices of the united nations can solve many of these vicious and complex problemsthe american people hope that one day soon the united nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world in the meantime we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regionsthat is why in the western hemisphere the united states has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the cuban people to live in freedom my administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the cuban government until it makes fundamental reformswe have also imposed tough calibrated sanctions on the socialist maduro regime in venezuela which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapsethe socialist dictatorship of nicolas maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country this corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried to make matters worse maduro has defied his own people stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rulethe venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing their democratic institutions are being destroyed this situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watchas a responsible neighbor and friend we and all others have a goal that goal is to help them regain their freedom recover their country and restore their democracy i would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the venezuelan peoplethe united states has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable we are prepared to take further action if the government of venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the venezuelan peoplewe are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the latin american countries gathered here today our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighborsi ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis we call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in venezuela applausethe problem in venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented applause from the soviet union to cuba to venezuela wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systemsamerica stands with every person living under a brutal regime our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action all people deserve a government that cares for their safety their interests and their wellbeing including their prosperityin america we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocalfor too long the american people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success but as those promises flowed millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared others gamed the system and broke the rules and our great middle class once the bedrock of american prosperity was forgotten and left behind but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten againwhile america will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government the duty of our citizens this bond is the source of america s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here todayif this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us it will depend as president truman said some 70 years ago on the independent strength of its members if we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together there can be no substitute for strong sovereign and independent nations nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies nations that seek allies to befriend not enemies to conquer and most important of all nations that are home to patriots to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spiritin remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they lovedpatriotism led the poles to die to save poland the french to fight for a free france and the brits to stand strong for britaintoday if we do not invest ourselves our hearts and our minds in our nations if we will not build strong families safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves no one can do it for uswe cannot wait for someone else for faraway countries or faroff bureaucrats we can t do it we must solve our problems to build our prosperity to secure our futures or we will be vulnerable to decay domination and defeatthe true question for the united nations today for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one are we still patriots do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures do we revere them enough to defend their interests preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizensone of the greatest american patriots john adams wrote that the american revolution was effected before the war commenced the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people that was the moment when america awoke when we looked around and understood that we were a nation we realized who we were what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend from its very first moments the american story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their futurethe united states of america has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty security and prosperity for allnow we are calling for a great reawakening of nations for the revival of their

LT GEN JOHN KELLY’S INCREDIBLE SPEECH Just Days After His Own Son Was Killed In Action: “Brave Men On Watch All Over the World Tonight—For YOU”,just days after the death of his own son in combat lt gen john kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable mannertwo years ago when i was the commander of all us and iraqi forces in fact the 22nd of april 2008 two marine infantry battalions 19 the walking dead and 28 were switching out in ramadi one battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon the other just starting its sevenmonth combat tourtwo marines corporal jonathan yale and lance corporal jordan haerter 22 and 20 years old respectively one from each battalion were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 marinesthe same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 iraqi police also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in ramadi a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by al qaeda yale was a dirt poor mixedrace kid from virginia with a wife and daughter and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well he did this on a yearly salary of less than 23000 haerter on the other hand was a middle class white kid from long islandthey were from two completely different worlds had they not joined the marines they would never have met each other or understood that multiple america s exist simultaneously depending on one s race education level economic status and where you might have been born but they were marines combat marines forged in the same crucible of marine training and because of this bond they were brothers as close or closer than if they were born of the same womanthe mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader i am sure went something like okay you two clowns stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass you clear i am also sure yale and haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like yes sergeant with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words no kidding sweetheart we know what we re doing they then relieved two other marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of joint security station nasser in the sophia section of ramadi al anbar iraqa few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 6070 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls the truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated killing them both catastrophically twentyfour brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed a mosque 100 yards away collapsed the truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stoppedour explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2000 pounds of explosives two died and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their dna to run from danger they saved 150 of their iraqi and american brothersinarmswhen i read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened i called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat we expect marines regardless of rank or mos to stand their ground and do their duty and even die in the process if that is what the mission takes but this just seemed differentthe regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed but reported that there were no american witnesses to the event just iraqi police i figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two marines to acknowledge their bravery i d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eyewitnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in washington would never buy iraqi statements if it had any chance at all it had to come under the signature of a general officeri traveled to ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a halfdozen iraqi police all of whom told the same story the blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine they all said we knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two marines began firing the iraqi police then related that some of them also fired and then to a man ran for safety just prior to the explosionall survived many were injured some seriously one of the iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said they d run like any normal man would to save his life what he didn t know until then he said and what he learned that very instant was that marines are not normal choking past the emotion he said sir in the name of god no sane man would have stood there and done what they did no sane man they saved us all what we didn t know at the time and only learned a couple of days later after i wrote a summary and submitted both yale and haerter for posthumous navy crosses was that one of our security cameras damaged initially in the blast recorded some of the suicide attack it happened exactly as the iraqis had described it it took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonatedyou can watch the last six seconds of their young lives putting myself in their heads i supposed it took about a second for the two marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley exactly no time to talk it over or call the sergeant to ask what they should do only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass the two marines had about five seconds left to live it took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons take aim and open up by this time the truck was halfway through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time here the recording shows a number of iraqi police some of whom had fired their aks now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the marines they had three seconds left to livefor about two seconds more the recording shows the marines weapons firing nonstop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the sonofabitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers american and iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two marines standing their ground if they had been aware they would have know they were safe because two marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomberthe recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two marines in all of the instantaneous violence yale and haerter never hesitated by all reports and by the recording they never stepped back they never even started to step aside they never even shifted their weight with their feet spread shoulder width apart they leaned into the danger firing as fast as they could work their weapons they had only one second left to livethe truck explodes the camera goes blank two young men go to their godsix secondsnot enough time to think about their families their country their flag or about their lives or their deaths but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty into eternity that is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you

“DIRTY JOBS” HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist, dirty jobs host mike rowe went off on a guy who claimed rowe is a white nationalist  the usual happygolucky rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to chuck adkinschuck adkins asked rowe one of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists comment no i m not surprised you never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody its bad for business i get it but there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country promoted by republicans those people love you and they think your initiative is their initiative meanwhile the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of adkins and the liberal media since we re being candid allow me to say how much i dislike your post everything about it annoys me your smug and snarky tone your appalling grammar your complete lack of evidence to support your claims and of course the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position rowe wrote what really bugs me though is the fact that you re not entirely wrong it s true i haven t shared any political opinions this week in part anyway because doing so might very well be bad for business what can i say i work for halfadozen different companies none of whom pay me to share my political opinions i run a nonpartisan foundation i m about to launch a new show on facebook and i m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs gilbert gottfried kathy griffin colin kaepernick milo yiannopoulos even that guy from google who just got himself fired for mouthing off there s no getting around it the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences and really that s fine by me he continued so no i m not going to share my personal feelings about charlottesville president trump or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square not just because it s bad for business but because it s annoying i can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion i value and i m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine rowe wrote so rather than blow myself up or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats i m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to thomas jefferson or a monument to george washington ready then rowe started in on adkins insinuations you say that white nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an academic elite you then say that republicans promote antiintellectualism you offer no proof to support either claim but it really doesn t matter your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief rowe said thus white nationalists and the republican party suddenly have something in common a contempt for higher education then you make it personal you say that republicans love me because they believe that my initiative and their initiative are one and the same but of course their initiative is now the same initiative as white nationalists he continued very clever without offering a shred of evidence you ve implied that republicans who support mikeroweworks do so because they believe i share their disdain for all things intellectual and poof just like that republicans white nationalists and mikeroweworks are suddenly conflated and the next thing you know i m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the nazis farfetched far from it rowe continued that s how logical fallacies work a flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion often leading to realworld consequences and right now logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches and other morons calling for more dead cops logical fallacies are everywhere not near done rowe wrote as i type this a democrat on cnn is making an argument that says because thomas jefferson owned slaves those republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are proslavery and therefore aligned with the modern day kkk that s a logical fallacy over on fox a republican is arguing that any democrat who has not yet condemned the senator from missouri for publicly wishing that donald trump be assassinated is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing that s a logical fallacy yesterday on the science channel neil degrasse tyson a noted astronomer tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate that s a logical fallacy then rowe turned the tables on his accuser continuing want to hear another one imagine something like this unfolding over on msnbc good evening america our top story tonight chuck atkins is a racist why because he can t spell just look at his grammar in a recent post on mike rowe s facebook page mr atkins while bemoaning america s global academic standing not only misspelled elitist he used tenants when he meant tenets he neglected to use a hyphen in antiintellectual and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes but why is he a racist you ask simple because everyone knows racists are ignorant chuck atkins is clearly a poor speller poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance ergo chuck atkins is a racist boom the matter is settled there s not much we can do about the news but here on facebook i think we can do better this isn t twitter rowe said we re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis take a moment chuck think make a rational argument otherwise just link us to a cat video people love those and they re almost never bad for business unless of course the cat gets hurt people hate that just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion here for instance are a few facts that matter to me with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of fostering antiintellectualism rowe then defended his charitable work writing mikeroweworks is a pr campaign for the skilled trades for the last nine years we ve partnered with numerous trade schools raised millions of dollars for workethic scholarships and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a fouryear degree but that doesn t mean we re antiintellectual we re not even anticollege we simply reject the popular notion that a fouryear degree is the best path for the most people and we re hardly alone millions of reasonable people republicans and democrats alike are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world they re worried about activist professors safe spaces the rising cost of tuition a growing contempt for history and a simmering disregard of the first amendment these people are concerned that our universities once beacons of free speech now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own and they re concerned deeply concerned that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a fouryear degree or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it returning to the original attack rowe concluded again these are not the concerns of antiintellectuals they are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country i don t know how many of these people are republicans but i can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education because i ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning to quote thomas jefferson while i still can if a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be on this point my foundation does not equivocate in other words chuck i have no idea what the white nationalists think about my efforts or the republicans the democrats the elitists the italians the presbyterians the unions or the selfproclaimed antiintellectuals and really i couldn t care less my question is why do you mike ps ok i ve just reread this in a desperate search for typos and i want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller this is probably not the time to trot out the grammar

Why Donald J. Trump Is The Only One Who Can Defeat An Anti-American Party That’s Gone Unopposed For 50 Years ,every american should read and share this brilliant articleso to my friends on the left and the nevertrumpers as well do i wish we lived in a time when our president could be collegial and dignified and proper  of course i do these aren t those times this is war and it s a war that the left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 yearsso say anything you want about this president i get it he can be vulgar he can be crude he can be undignified at times i don t care i can t spare this man he fightshe fightsmy leftist friends as well as many ardent nevertrumpers constantly ask me if i m not bothered by donald trump s lack of decorum they ask if i don t think his tweets are beneath the dignity of the office here s my answerwe rightthinking people have tried dignity there could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than george w bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency we tried statesmanship could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized collegiality as john mccain we tried propriety has there been a nicer human being ever than mitt romney and the results were always the samethis is because while we were playing by the rules of dignity collegiality and propriety the left has been for the past 60 years engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of saul alinsky and the chicago mobi don t find anything dignified collegial or proper about barack obama s lying about what went down on the streets of ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the democratic party i don t see anything dignified in lying about the deaths of four americans in benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks i don t see anything statesmanlike in weaponizing the irs to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent yes obama was articulate and polished but in no way was he in the least bit dignified collegial or proper the left has been engaged in a war against america since the rise of the children of the 60s to them it has been an allout war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale it has been a war they ve fought with violence the threat of violence demagoguery and lies from day one the violent takeover of the universities till todaythe problem is through these years the left has been the only side fighting this war while the left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way the right has continued to act with dignity collegiality and proprietywith donald trump this all has come to an end donald trump is america s first wartime president in the culture warduring wartime things like dignity and collegiality simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors ulysses grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the army for conduct unbecoming had abraham lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted grant the democrats might well still be holding their slaves today lincoln rightly recognized that i cannot spare this man he fights general george patton was a vulgartalking sonofabitch in peacetime this might have seen him stripped of rank but had franklin roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum then hitler and the socialists would barely be five decades into their thousandyear reichtrump is fighting and what s particularly delicious is that like patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated rommel s he s shouting you magnificent bastards i read your book that is just the icing on the cake but it s wonderful to see that not only is trump fighting he s defeating the left using their own tacticsthat book is saul alinsky s rules for radicals a book so essential to the liberals war against america that it is and was the playbook for the entire obama administration and the subject of hillary clinton s senior thesis it is a book of such pure evil that just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted alinsky dedicated his book to lucifertrump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but in reality he is doing exactly what alinsky suggested his followers do first instead of going after the fake media and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong but diametrically opposed to the truth from the tet offensive to benghazi to what really happened on the streets of ferguson missouri trump has isolated cnn he made it personal then just as alinsky suggests he employs ridicule which alinsky described as the most powerful weapon of all everyone gets that it s not just cnn in fact in a world where al sharpton and rachel maddow paul krugman and nicholas kristof are people of influence and whose reporting is in no way significantly different than cnn s cnn is just a pikermost importantly trump s tweets have put cnn in an untenable and unwinnable position with trump s ability to go around them they cannot simply stand pat they need to respond this leaves them with only two choicesthey can either go high as hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can doubledown on their usual tactics and hope to defeat trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguerythe problem for cnn et al with the former is if they were to start honestly reporting the news that would be the end of the democratic party they serve it is nothing but the incessant use of fake news read propaganda that keeps the left alive imagine for example if cnn had honestly and accurately reported thencandidate barack obama s close ties to foreign terrorists rashid khalidi domestic terrorists william ayers the mafia tony rezko or the true evils of his spiritual mentor jeremiah wright s churchimagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the obama administration s weaponizing of the irs to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of ambassador christopher stevens and the obama administration s coverup this makes going high a nonstarter for cnn this leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news conjuring up the next nothing burger and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s worse than nixon this obviously is what cnn has chosen to do the problem is as they become more and more hysterical they become more and more obvious each new effort at even faker news than before and faker outrage only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that trump is and always has been right about the fake news mediaand by causing their hysteria trump has forced them into numerous highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes thus in their desperation they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that even with the liberal lower case l  libel laws protecting the media they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedlytheir flailing at trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality with cnn using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an internet meme this threat to dox release of personal information to encourage coideologists to visit violence upon him and his family a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him if it were there would have been no reason for cnn to have made their deal with him publicinstead cnn playing by chicago rules was sending a message to any and all dissent will not be tolerated this heavyhanded and hysterical response to a joke on the internet has backfired on cnn giving rise to only more righteous ridiculeso to my friends on the left and the nevertrumpers as well do i wish we lived in a time when our president could be collegial and dignified and proper  of course i do these aren t those times this is war and it s a war that the left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 yearsso say anything

WATCH: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM DROPS BOMBSHELL… FINALLY Confirms The Fake Russian Dossier Was Used To Obtain FISA Warrant To Spy On Trump,everyone suspected the sketchy steele dossier was what corrupt fbi and doj officials used to get the october 2016 fisa warrant against trump fbi and doj officials refuse to answer that question publiclyrep ron desantis rfl said in a statement we now know that the socalled steele dossier was paid for by the democratic party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding thencandidate trump what the american people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by steele on the democrats dime was used by the obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against trump associates the fbi has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of congress the trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against trump or his associates immediately after his inauguration president trump came out swinging over the fake russian dossier he even went as far as to blame the intelligence community president trump was immediately criticized for his comments and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory as it turns out he wasn t too far off the markct despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question and despite numerous oncamera questions to fbi and doj officials about the 2016 fisa process noone had definitively confirmed the christopher steele russian dossier was the underlying evidence for the 2016 fisa application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential

he was hearing was serious but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it watch at starting at the 0410 mark the backstory to the fisa warrant is the cornerstone the backstory contains both the fbi and the doj scheme expose it remove it and the entire muh russia conspiracy collapses under the weight of sunlight this is critical and important because the specific use of the steele dossier underpins the big ugly and exposes the entire toptier apparatus of the fbi counterintelligence division peter strzok bill priestap james baker andrew mccabe and the doj national security division john carlin stuart evans mary mccord and sally yates as well as doj bruce ohr and fbi lawyer lisa page directly to conspiracy chargesthe 2016 fbi counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the trump campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a fisa warrant sold as a defense of us democracy from russia which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etcthe doj involvement surrounds legal arguments processing of fisa applications and use of the legal system to support the fbi operation with actionable legal framing against trump the doj national security division carried out that collaboration with the fbitablet mag did a deep dive into the fusiongps connection to the creation of the steele dossier and more specifically how fusiongps head glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the white house prior to the doj and fbi applying for the fisa warrant see heretablet mag outlines how mary jacoby even bragged about getting the russiagate narrative starteda tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the nowfamous dossier suggests that central elements of the russiagate scandal emerged not from the british exspy christopher steele s topsecret sources in the russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from russian government control but from a series of stories that fusion gps cofounder glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby cowrote for thewall street journal well before fusion gps existed and donald trump was simply another loudmouthed manhattan real estate millionaireunderstanding the origins of the steele dossier is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the united states  in a facebook post from june 24 2017 that tablet has seen in screenshots jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for russiagate she has not replied to repeated requests for comment it s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what glenn s role was in exposing putin s control of donald trump jacoby wrote let s be clear glenn conducted the investigation glenn hired chris steele chris steele worked for glenn this assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the steele dossier on which the russiagate narrative is founded read morethe tabletmag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished steele dossier entering into the white house and how president obama likely saw and reviewed the contenthowever missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefariousremember previous media reporting in conjunction with clinton campaign admissions have confirmed the dnc and clinton campaign financed fusiongps through their lawyers within perkins coie fusion then hired nellie ohr the wife of doj deputy bruce ohr who thereafter subcontracted with retired british mi6 agent christopher steele to writeresearchprovide credibility for the dossier the dates here are important because they tell a storythe origin of the clinton effort with fusiongps was april 2016 that s the same month fusion hired nellie ohr wife of doj deputy bruce ohr to gather opposition research on candidate trump it would be most likely that nellie ohr was in contact with christopher steele doj deputy attorney bruce ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with christopher steele and fusiongps founder glenn simpson in october 2016 the same month the fisa warrant was grantedhowever there was another event in this april 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the dossier origination hat tip katica check this outin april 2016 mary jacoby shows up on white house visitor logs meeting with president obama officials in april 2016 the clinton campaign and dnc hired fusiongps to organize the russia research that later became known as the steele dossier link to white house logsthe wife of glenn simpson fusion gps mary b jacoby with years of russiaangled reporting including donald trump visits the white house in april 2016 at the same time as the dnc and clinton hire fusion gps to conduct the opposition research on donald trump surrounding russiathis timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidentalexpand slightly and considerapril mary jacoby wife of fusion gps founder glenn simpson visits the white house the clinton campaign and dnc then hire fusion gps to conduct opposition research  with a russian emphasis fusion gps then hires nellie ohr who specializes in russiancentric counterintelligence nellie ohr then contacts mi6 agent christopher steele to write a russian dossier a month later may 2016 nellie ohr s husband inside the doj bruce ohr is then working with fbi counterintelligence head peter strzok by june 2016 peter strzok bruce ohr and doj attorney lisa page then apply for the first fisa warrantjune 24th 2017 mary jacoby appears on facebook taking credit for the origination of the russiagate narrativethis timeline is so transparent it s deafeningmore from the tablet simpson and jacoby had id d manafort as a worldclass sleazeball and they were right a slick georgetown law grad running in gop circles since the reagan campaign manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people i would only add here that in my personal experience journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written especially stories with a character like manafort at the centerso when the trump campaign named paul manafort as its campaign convention manager on march 28 2016 you can bet that simpson and jacoby s eyes lit up and as it happened at the exact same time that trump hired manafort fusion gps was in negotiations with perkins coie the law firm representing the clinton campaign and the dnc to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the trump campaign they had started for the washington free beacon moremary jacoby and glenn simpson fusion gpsif the counterintelligence fisa warrant was obtained through deception misleadingmanipulated information or fraud and that warrant is what led to the wiretapping and surveillance of candidate donald trump and general flynn and that warrant was authorized by fisa court judge contreras who was the judge in flynn s case and is now recused the entire tenuous fbi and doj operation begins to collapse and the

BILL NYE The FAKE Science Guy THREATENS Conservatives…Blue States Will “Impose Economic Sanctions” Against Climate Change Denying States,friday on msnbc climate activist bill nye warned conservatives to watch out saying progressive blue states will address climate change on their ownnye said only 40 percent of people in the us think that congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups especially from the fossil fuel industry have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty plus or minus two percent is the same as plus or minus 100 percent he continued there s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writlarge states rights just watch out conservatives if states rights include california illinois new york these places that where people voted in a progressive fashion watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions either overtly or by default on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way he added we ve got to remind people that we re all in this together the people i think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies we want to engage everybody not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest it is not in the best interest especially of your children and grandchildren a couple of times you mentioned that i am against the president and so on i m not especially against the president i just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future this is true not just with regard to the national debt which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved ronald reagan not only will that national debt increase but the climate debt in a sense what we have to do to address climate change will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down breitbart newsthe climate change debate went nuclear last year over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the national oceanic and atmospheric association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming pause in an article on the climate etc blog john bates who retired last year as principal scientist of the national climatic data center accused the lead author of the 2015 noaa pausebuster report of trying to discredit the hiatus through flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards in addition mr bates told the daily uk mail that the report s author former noaa national centers for environmental information director thomas karl did so by insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation gradually in the months after the report came out the evidence kept mounting that tom karl constantly had his thumb on the scale in the documentation scientific choices and release of datasets in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy mr bates said saturday on climate etcthe june 2015 report possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus which updated the ocean temperature record was published six months before the un s paris summitthe accusations sparked a fierce backandforth sunday between socalled climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of mr bates claim which he defended on the climate etc blog run by former georgia tech climatologist judith curryzeke hausfather berkeley earth climate scientist said in a sunday factcheck on the carbonbrief blog that the karl paper s conclusions have been validated by independent data from satellites buoys and argo floats and many other independent groups while noaa s data management procedures may well need improvement their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups mr hausfather said citing berkeley earth and the uk s met office hadley centrehe said the record strongly suggests that noaa got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years meanwhile the whistleblowing prompted a wetoldyouso moment from republicans on the house science space and technology committee who have long suspected the obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 19982013 pause in global temperature increases now that dr bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within noaa about the quality and transparency of the data before publication we know why noaa fought transparency and oversight at every turn said chairman lamar smith in a sunday statementthe panel launched an investigation into the noaa pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the socalled clean power plan and upcoming paris climate conference dr bates revelations and noaa s obstruction certainly lend credence to what i ve expected all along that the karl study used flawed data was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored noaa s own standards for scientific study mr smith saidmr bates said he decided to come forward after reading a washington post article dec 13 that said federal scientists are frantically copying us climate data fearing it might vanish under trump as a climate scientist formerly responsible for noaa s climate archive the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data he said on climate etcin his experience the most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of tom karl et al 2015 hereafter referred to as the karl study or k15 purporting to show no hiatus in global warming in the 2000s noaa did not return immediately sunday a request for comment the daily mail said that mr karl admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published but denied trying to influence the climate summit asked why he had not waited he said john bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time he denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for paris saying there was no discussion about paris said the daily mail articlethe american geophysical union issued a statement saying it was very closely monitoring the situation have considered the possible implications and will be sharing any new information or response by agu with you here ,left-news,30-Dec-17,0

WHY OBAMA’S CORRUPT INNER CIRCLE Is Desperately Fighting To Protect His Failed Reputation, history shows that we can if we must tolerate nuclear weapons in north korea those words were written by former national security adviser susan rice on thursday in the new york times in arguing for appeasement towards kim jongunit was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with barack obama s feckless foreign policy and it explains why the world that president donald trump inherited is so dangerous and unstablethe obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the us could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone breitbartnoah rothman of commentary magazine wrote a brilliant article about the death rattle of obama s reputation  in his article rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former president barack obama took our nation down and why the successes of president trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against trump in defense of obama s failed legacythe members of barack obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual former cia director john brennan accused donald trump and his administration of engaging in outrageous narcissistic behavior typical of vengeful autocrats by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the united states in the united nations as though that were unprecedented it is not james clapper obama s director of national intelligence all but alleged that the president is a russian asset perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former democratic president s foreignpolicy professionals were placed in the new york times by obama s national security advisor susan rice in her estimation america has abdicated its role as a force for good rice s attacks on the republican administration deserve the most attention if only because they are the most apoplectic donald trump s recently released nationalsecurity review paints a dark almost dystopian vision of the world rice contended his world is full of hostile states and lurking threats rice claimed that there is no common good in trump s worldview what s more there is no international community and no universal values there are just american values rice acknowledges that moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace western values and us sovereignty she implies that trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that in fact it was obama much more so than trump who has failed to see the obviousbarack obama was inarguably the least atlanticist president since the end of world war ii within a year of russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former soviet republic of georgia obama scrapped george w bushera agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to central europe in 2013 the last of america s armored combat units left europe ending a 69year footprint on the continent by 2014 there were just two us army brigades stationed in europe the folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when vladimir putin became the first russian leader since stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring ukrainea year later putin intervened militarily in syria where us forces were already operating resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the cold war putin s move in syria should not have come as a surprise barack obama outsourced the resolution of the syrian conflict to moscow in 2013 if only to avoid making good on his selfset red line for intervention in that conflict despite the normshattering use of wmds on civilians even rice s chief complaint about trump his failure to condemn putin s brazen intervention in the 2016 election didn t elicit a reaction from barack obama until the final month of his presidencyby contrast and to the surprise of just about everyone the trump administration has been tough on russia trump has ordered harsh sanctions on moscow s iranian allies for violating united nations resolutions a course the obama administration declined to take even if it allowed hezbollah terrorists with direct links to putin to operate with impunity he ordered long overdue airstrikes on putin s vassal regime in syria halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process trump not only declined to lift obamaera sanctions on moscow as many feared he would but expanded them this administration closed russian consulates and annexes in the united states it has targeted putin allies like chechen strongman ramzan kadyrov under the magnitsky act the same act that kremlin cutout natalia veselnitskaya lobbied the trump campaign to scuttle trump has even gone so far as to open us arms sales to ukraine representing a significant blow to putin s ambitions in europe it is without a doubt that trump now has a stronger record on russia than barack obama ever did no wonder susan rice is so angryrice further alleged that trump recklessly accused china of being an avowed opponent of the us rather than just a competitor and then insisted that china has not illegally occupied its neighbors tell that to brunei malaysia the philippines vietnam or taiwan each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the south china sea that the people s republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases rice suggested that trump s realists decided to lump beijing in with moscow not because it is a rising military and economic power but because they wanted to placate american nationalists though this white house declined to defibrillate the transpacific partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with beijing to isolate pyongyang than obama did as the north korean nuclear crisis intensifies china has backed fresh sanctions on north korean financial institutions cut off all access to chinese iron lead and coal and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the stalinist state by as much as 90 percent and all in the space of one yearrice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the us should labor lgbt people people in poverty people with aids people under 30 et cetera rather the document insists that all mankind regardless of conditions or accidents of birth are objects of us interest rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security good climate change is not itself a threat to american national security but a threat multiplier as the weather has always been save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of us freetrade obligations rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante in nearly all respects it was obama s white house not trump s that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the us and the world less safe as a resulteven as early as march of 2017 it was clear that the obama administration s foreignpolicy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of american interests abroad they had every reason to be for now at least the trump administration has declined to govern as trump campaigned not as a populist firebrand but a conventional republican susan rice and her former white house colleagues have every reason to worry but not for the united states their reputations however are another matter entirelyto read the entire article click here ,left-news,23-Dec-17,0

bundy s theft of government property chargethe jury returned its verdict after some six weeks of testimony followed by less than six hours deliberations and the last minute replacement of a juror after an allegation surfaced that he was biasedthe jury was instructed to disregard their previous work and to reconsider the evidence it was a pretty jawdropping verdict said opb reporter amelia templeton of the climate in the courtroom the jury began by reading out the verdict for ammon bundy ostensibly the leader of the occupation and when we heard that ammon bundy was not guilty it became clear very quickly that likely no one in the case was going to be found guilty and indeed everyone has been acquitted after the verdict was read ammon bundy s attorney marcus mumford was tackled to

information the company has a twentyfiveyear track record of failing to comply with federal workplacesafety standards michaels saidcase farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few americans would put up with when these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers avoid paying for injuries and quash dissent thirty years ago congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for

lauren mcgaughy who wrote about a lawyer who was fired from his law firm for posting an article written by a rape survivor about her views on the now hijacked feminazi metoo movement it s sad to see the left grabbing onto the serious issue of sexual assault and doing the exact same thing they did to racism using it as a political football and trying to make it a republican or conservative thing if everyone s a racist then no one is a racist lauren mcgaughy a reporter for dallas morning news didn t stop at exposing the firing of a top texas lawyer over an article he shared on his personal facebook page about the metoo movement that was written by a rape survivor she went after him with a bizarre vengeance as though she had been personally harmed by his words mcgaughy didn t stop after pointing out that his law firm fired andrew d leonie in a shameful case of censorship she went on to tie him to conservatives and prove that he s actually gasp supported republican candidates in the past mcgaughy took it a step further and provided evidence that this horrible human being was also involved in litigating a case against are you ready muslim students praying in public schoolsmcgaughy wrote leonie was behind an ag s office letter that blasted a friscoarea high school for allowing muslim students to use an empty classroom to pray the letter which alleged the school might be infringing on the constitutional rights of its nonmuslim students was called a political stunt by district staff who said the room was open to all studentsfrom the dallas morning news articlea top lawyer in the office of texas attorney general ken paxton resigned thursday after reports he wrote a facebook post that called women s sexual misconduct allegations pathetic the dallas morning news reported thursday morning associate deputy attorney general andrew d leonie posted on facebook this week aren t you also tired of all the pathetic me too victim claims if every woman is a victim  so is every man if everyone is a victim no one is victim means nothing anymore the post went up at 240 am on wednesday by thursday afternoon leonie had resigned in a press release paxton s office said leonie s exit was effective immediately the views he expressed on social media do not reflect our values paxton s director of communications marc rylander wrote the oag is committed to promoting and maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment leonie s post was removed late thursday afternoon his bio was changed from associate deputy attorney general to retired the dallas morning news was fortunately able to get a screen shot of the offensive post for everyone to seehis facebook post linked to an article from the conservative website the federalist titled can we be honest about women the teaser to the article which was written by a woman states here s a little secret we have to say out loud women love the sexual interplay they experience with men and they relish men desiring their beauty he previously worked for paxton s predecessor gov greg abbott as a regional chief for consumer protection and special litigator according to leonie s linkedin his salary was listed as 150984 in april on the texas tribune s salary explorerleonie s post comes as some conservatives question the increasing number of sexual harassment and assault claims against the nation s most powerful men in media politics and business while the stories have led to a number of highprofile resignations and apologies in the private sector change is slower in the political realm where it s usually up to voters to oust elected officials accused of sexual misconductin texas for example republican congressman blake farenthold on thursday decided not to run for reelection after allegations he made lewd comments and unleashed profanitylaced tirades on staffers the decision was made after farenthold declined to resign for weeks after news broke he once used 84000 in taxpayer money to settlement a harassment claim accusations against state lawmakers as well as concerns over the ability of elected officials to harass with impunity have also led to new training requirements in the legislatureoops it looks likethe federalistreported that leonie s facebook post linked to an article entitled can we be honest about women authored by mcallister who is a survivor of sexual assault here s a little secret we have to say out loud women love the sexual interplay they experience with men and they relish men desiring their beauty mcallister writes why because it is part of their nature as a society we need to encourage both sexes to become comfortable with who they are naturally and all the messy uncomfortable stumbling tantalizing and glorious twists and turns that come with it she continues men and women need to show each other grace and respect as they engage as sexual beings in whatever sphere they interact the article explicitly condemns sexual assault but argues that what some call sexual assault doesn t deserve that label and expanding its definition into innocent behavior hurts both men and women in the past mcallister has written about how our society has emboldened men in positions of power to think they can get away with sexually harassing or assaulting womenin a post entitled it s not up to women to end sexual harassment she explains why men need to step up their efforts to protect women from such evils she has also criticized aspects of the metoo movement writing recently that it is destroying trust between men and women because the social media movement denies human naturethe sexual tension between men and women will always exist and if women assume a man s sexuality is a threat instead of a powerful complement to their own sexuality they will always be on guard in this environment of suspicion there can be no privacy between a man and a woman if there is any kind of interaction or discourse even if it s not sexual the man can t trust that the woman won t use it against him so communication is silenced fear is generated on both sides and fear is the death of trust it is also the death of lovethroughout mcallister s critiques of the metoo movement and discussions of sexual topics she has repeatedly stated that women ought to be respected and that sexual assault and sexual harassment are wrong a fact left out of

change from a list of national security threats the national security strategy to be released on monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system a draft of the national security strategy slated to be released on monday said us leadership is indispensable to countering an antigrowth energy agenda that is detrimental to us economic and energy security interests given future global energy demand much of the developing world will require fossil fuels as well as other forms of energy to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty during his successful campaign trump mocked obama s placement of climate change in the context of national security here s a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in hilton head south carolina in late 2015so obama s always talking about the global warming that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem ok no no think of it i mean even if you re a believer in global warming isis is a big problem russia s a problem china s a problem we ve got a lot of problems by the way the maniac in north korea is a problem he actually has nuclear weapons right that s a problemwe ve got a lot of problems we

KARMA: Race-Obsessed Detroit Free Press Editorial Editor Who Led Effort To Destroy Kid Rock’s Career Is FIRED Over Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior With Female Colleagues,in september 2016 stephen henderson the editorial editor of the detroit free press used the power of his pen to unjustly attack kid rock after liberals feared rock might actually be serious about running as a republican contender against the donothing democrat senator debbie stabenow as a michigan resident i can say with a great level of confidence that besides mike illitch the now deceased owner of the red wings and detroit tigers kid rock has done more for the city of detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state when the illitch s asked detroit legend and philanthropist kid rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated little caesar s arena no one could have dreamed that the detroit free press stephen henderson would have used his position to push a lie that kid rock the single father of a black son and naacp award recipient is a racist here s what henderson had to say about kid rock the man who has done so much for the city of detroitthis is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music who used to wrap his brand in the confederate flag a symbol inextricably linked to racism no matter what its defenders say and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of african americans pushing back against american inequality just last week he trashed colin kaepernick the former san francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent kneeling protest during the prefootball game singing of the national anthem having kid rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to detroiters nothing less and the ilitches who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it should be the last to embrace that kind of signalinghere is how kid rock responded on his facebook pagepeople pay no attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create and by the way fuck the extreme left and the extreme rightthey are trying to use the old confederate flag bs etc to stir the pot when we all know none of this would be going on if i were not thinking of running for office pretty funny how scared i have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people  me racist who do not agree or cower to them no one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at lca back in january my track record in detroit and michigan speaks for itself and i would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine i am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of detroit so suck on that tooi am the bona fide king of detroit love and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our cityi am however very disappointed that none of the people businesses or charities i have so diligently supported in detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and the detroit free press so for the unforeseen future i will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones i have supported in the past i would however employ that nan go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people i love idiots  has al sharpton even paid his back taxes yettoday the raceobsessed stephen henderson got some very bad news ap the detroit free press fired stephen henderson its managing director of opinion and commentary after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues the newspaper announced fridayfree press editor and vice president peter bhatia announced henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years gannett co inc the newspaper s parent company says henderson s behavior has been inconsistent with company values and standards henderson said in a statement to the detroit news and crain s detroit business that he is stunned i dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades all of it performing at the highest level henderson said i may have more to say on this later but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of detroit stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for detroit bhatia said he added there were no accusations of sexual assault but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at free press employees ran counter to company policiesless than 2 months ago henderson appeared on meet the press and called america a racist nation with a racist historyrich lowry of the national review appeared with stephen henderson on meet the press to discuss colin kaepernick and other nfl players who disrespect the flag as a way to support black lives matter henderson argued some of the words in the national anthem are racist henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the american flag because he thinks america is a country whose history is racist henderson told the panel i think this is a country whose history is racist whose history is steeped in white supremacy and the anthem reflects that in its very words inaudible  lowry responded to henderson by saying it s also a nation with

DOCTOR MENTIONED In Hillary Email Released By Wikileaks Found DEAD In Apartment…Police Say He Committed Suicide By Stabbing Himself To Death??,54yearold dr dean lorich associate director of orthopaedic trauma service at the hospital for special surgery as well as the chief of the orthopedic trauma service at newyorkpresbyterian hospital was found dead in his apartment earlier this weekaccording to new york city police he committed suicide by stabbing himself to deaththat s a pretty normal way to commit suicide rightit s like the time when former president of the united nations general assembly john ashe was found dead in his apartment only days before he was set to testify against the clintons in a corruption case the official reports indicated that ashe died of a heart attackthe problem however is that police on the scene reported ashe died when his throat was crushed during a workout accidentadding to the mysterious nature of ashe s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court monday with his chinese businessman codefendant ng lap seng from whom he reportedly received over 1 billion in donations during his term as president of the un general assembly and then there was this during the presidency of bill clinton seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the democrat national committeenow abc news is reportingan acclaimed trauma surgeon was found dead with a knife in his torso sunday in his park avenue apartment in a suspected suicide new york city police saiddr dean lorich 54 was the associate director of the orthopedic trauma service at the hospital for special surgery who treated bono in 2014 after the u2 frontman was badly injured in a cycling accident in central parklorich was also a professor at weill cornell medical collegehis death is being investigated as an apparent suicide a new york police department official told abc newsinitial investigations did not find any signs of forced entry at his apartment the official said authorities have not found a suicide notepolice responding to a 911 call of an assault in a park avenue apartment at 105 pm sunday found lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso according to the nypd emergency medical service responders pronounced him deadthe email wikileaks published was highly critical of the failed relief efforts in haiti and was shared by cheryl mills with hillary clintonin 2010 lorich was part of a relief effort that flew to haiti as a volunteer to offer his skills for civilians who had been injured during the earthquakes that devastated the regionwithin 24 hours of the earthquake a 13member team of surgeons anesthesiologists and operating room nurses was assembled with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment and flew to portauprince with dr lorichbill and hillary clinton s charitable clinton foundation led the relief effort in haiti raising millions of dollars from around the world to help the people recover from the natural disaster sadly most of the funds never reached the people of haiti but instead lined the pockets of the clintons associates who were meant to redevelop the nation but never delivereddr lorich and his team were there to help save the limbs of those injured which without the proper medical treatment would have meant amputation for a lot of peoplelorich described amputation in those conditions as a death sentence and hoped to treat as many sufferers as possible saying we expected many amputations but we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable particularly those of children we recognized that in an underdeveloped country a limb amputation may be a death sentence it does not have to be so with the amount of money that was being donated to haiti for the victims lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched downinstead he described the situation as shameful and witnessed first hand a huge misappropriation of funds with the people affected by the disaster receiving no help whatsoeverdr lorich was disgusted by what he saw and sent an email to thensecretary of state hillary clinton s chief of staff cheryl d mills to report what he had seenin july 2017 a 50yearold haitian tied to the clinton foundation was found dead with a gunshot wound to his headit s no secret that the clinton foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished haitians who were devastated by hurricane hanna in 2008 through their foundation haitians have been protesting for years outside of the clinton foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the clinton foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poorone man was set to testify against the clinton foundation next week that man was 50yearold former haitian government official klaus eberwein he was found dead in his miami home with a gunshot to the head that s been ruled a suicide by the miamidade s medical examiner records supervisor think vince fosterklaus eberwein a former haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of clinton foundation corruption and malpractice next week has been found dead in miami he was 50eberwein was due to appear next tuesday before the haitian senate ethics and anticorruption commission where he was widely expected to testify that the clinton foundation misappropriated haiti earthquake donations from international donorseberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the clinton foundation s activities in the caribbean island where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency fonds d assistance conomique et social for three yearsaccording to eberwein a paltry 06 of donations granted by international donors to the clinton foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting haitians actually ended up in the hands of haitian organizations a further 96 ended up with the haitian government the remaining 898 or 54 billion was funneled to nonhaitian organizations the clinton foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace eberwein said at a protest outside the clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan last yearthe former director general of haiti who also served as an advisor to haitian president michel martelly was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in haiti muncheez and even has a pizza the klaus special named after himaccording to the haiti libre newspaper eberwein was said to be in good spirits  with plans for the future his close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide it s really shocking said muncheez s owner gilbert bailly we grew up together he was like family your news wireamericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the clinton crime family when in september of 2016 former senate president of haiti bernard sansaricq shocked a large crowd at a trump campaign event in little haiti fl sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the clinton s dirty dealings in haiti while he was still in office to his credit candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the clinton s who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white housesansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to side with the clinton administration and he would be the richest man in haiti he also demanded that hillary clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the haiti earthquake crisis as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation not even 2 of that money went back to haiti so mr trump we are asking you begging you the haitian community will side with you if one day you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in 2010 after the earthquake haiti is a very poor country haiti needs defenders you said you would champion our cause we welcome you sir and we will work with you ask hillary clinton publicly during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti only a couple of days before eberwein s death a republican donor and operative from chicago s north shore who said he had tried to obtain hillary clinton s missing emails from russian hackers killed himself in a minnesota hotel room days after talking to the wall street journal about his efforts public records showin a room at a rochester hotel used almost exclusively by

WATCH: INTERNATIONAL SHOPLIFTING PUNK LiAngelo Ball Makes Disgusting Admission About His Apology To President Trump…Proves He’s No Better Than His Ungrateful Dad,it s beyond sad to watch these young men sitting through an interview with their overbearing loudmouth dad controlling their every move it s especially disturbing to see lavar ball and the hosts of the breakfast club laughing about liangelo and his fellow ucla basketball players stealing louis vuitton sunglasses in chinahe certainly isn t doing them any favors liangelo ball said he wouldn t have apologized to president trump if ucla didn t make him do soafter ball and teammates cody riley and jalen hill were arrested and released for shoplifting in china the trio held a press conference after arriving in the united states where they thanked trump for his role in their release but according to liangelo who along with his dad lavar spoke about the apology with the breakfast club wednesday morning an apology wouldn t have been in the cards if he knew he wasn t going to play for ucla againwatch as lavar ball the father of 2 of these 3 unfortunate young men that were part of the interview with the breakfast club talks about how differently he d be treated if he were white perhaps someone should explain to lavar that the real reason he offends everyone within earshot of his big mouth is because he s an arrogant ass who owes any attention he gets from the media to his son s athletic abilities which of course he takes full credit for they wanted to hear that and he tweeted about it before my speech so i had to add it in there right before i gave it liangelo told the power 1051 morning showaccording to the middle ball son the school reminded him about trump right before he went up to speak to the press if they didn t tell me to do it it wouldn t have been in there ball said on the program in reference to the trump apologytrump fired off a tweet after the ucla players returned questioning whether they would thank him for facilitating their releasetrump s tweet then prompted lavar ball to question how exactly trump helped who ball told espn what was he over there for don t tell me nothing everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out ball s response led to more beef between the two with ball reigniting the feud earlier in december when he tweeted a cartoon showing him dunking on the commanderinchiefliangelo who was suspended indefinitely by ucla left the school weeks later and along with his younger brother lamelo signed a professional contract with lithuania basketball club prienu vytautas this week nypon november 21 2017 we published an article about how a family member revealed the sick reason lavar ball allegedly wouldn t let his sons see their mother after surgery to remove portion of her skull so who is this crackpot lavar ball and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the president of the united states just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country andrew stephens of the armchair all americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the selfserving money and fameobsessed lavar ball really is in his article stephens reveals a sick man who is so controlling of his 3 sons and their basketball careers that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brandon march 15 2017 andrew stephens of armchair all americans published an article about lavar ball titled lavar ball the epitome of what is wrong with modern sports it touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable childrenstephens claimed that in the article without commenting on upbringing tactics i attempted to delve into lavar ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefitabout an hour after the article was run i received a comment on it from a member of the ball family who wishes to remain anonymous the comment which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter read as follows wow you nailed it although you don t even know the half of it lavar took over the high school program added the coach his puppet which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year and lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court if you are allowed to shoot at any time from anywhere and never come out of the game any decent idiot could score 30 pointsalso tina ball his wife had a stroke on feb 21 she had lifethreatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure guess where lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife at the chhs vs lb poly game with his sons including lonzo he still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him and cause bbb sales to diminish name of hospital in city of hospital ca tina is there now and he only visits for 1 hour a few days a week while her mother has yet to leave her side pathetic

SENATOR GILLIBRAND Pulled Strings So Muslim Athlete Who Molested 12-Year Old Girl Could Come To U.S. After His Visa Was Denied,democrat senator kristen gillibrand ny likes to think of herself as a champion of women after multiple women came forward to accuse fellow democrat senator al franken of sexual assault photos were also supplied as evidence of one of the accuser s claims gillibrand finally called for franken to step down was gillibrand s call for her fellow senator to step down part of a larger plan to appear neutral as she then attacked president donald trump for unfounded allegations against him only months before the election isn t it kind of hypocritical for gillibrand to call anyone out of sexual misconduct after she fought to bring a muslim athlete to upstate new york who molested an innocent 12year old girl while he was in americathe media cheered when ny democrat senator s kirsten gillibrand and chuck schumer helped a 24yr old muslim man enter the us after

discovered that the islamic extremist who killed 9 people and injured dozens of others when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in new york city entered our country on a diversity visa

international competitions as we often do when local communities ask for help at the request of saranac lake we helped to navigate the visa process so these athletes could compete at a local competition the charges against one member of the group who is accused of a serious crime and abusing our visa program are extremely troubling if he s found guilty he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law a rep saidgillibrand s office offered a similar response adding that the charges are extremely serious hussain hails from the indian side of the disputed himalayan region of kashmir which is predominantly muslim although india is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban hussain and khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the united states was turned down in late january the first business day after trump s travel ban was put in placekhan told the bbc that an employee at the us embassy in

recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal they re valedictorians they re first responders they re curing diseases they root for the yankees they want to serve in the army if daca recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally these are the poster children for the poster children chicago tribune34 republicans in congress are not about to let the pesky facts about obama s dreamers get in the way of lobbying speaker ryan to grant them permanent citizenshipnumbers usa reports thirtyfour republicans in the house of representatives signed a letter to house speaker paul ryan calling for passage of a permanent daca amnesty before the end of the year reps scott taylor rva and dan newhouse rwash led the effortwhile the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a daca amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s mustpass spending bill they don t insist on any other immigrationrelated provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory everify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to chain migrationthe letter readsdear speaker ryanwe write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for deferred action for childhood arrivals daca recipients before the end of the year daca recipients young people brought to america through no fault of their own are contributing members of our communities and our economy for many this is the only country they have ever known they are american in every way except their immigration statussince daca s inception the federal government has approved approximately 795000 initial daca applications and 924000 renewals since being approved for daca status an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school found employment or have served in the military studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product gdp that is why the business community universities and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solutionwe agree with president trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue as was done under the previous administration and we believe congress should act we are compelled to act immediately because many daca recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communitieswhile we firmly believe congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system it is imperative that republicans and democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year we all agree that our border must be enforced our national security defended and our broken immigration system reformed but in this moment we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hardworking young people we must pass legislation that protects daca recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible reaching across the aisle

IT’S WORSE THAN THEY THOUGHT: Doctors Discover US Embassy Victims In Cuba Have BRAIN ABNORMALITIES…”Never Before Seen Illness”,in a lastminute attempt to create a legacy for himself obama traveled to cuba to hang out with raul castro and prove to americans how easy it is to form relations with brutal dictators of oppressive regimes unfortunately for barack obama it was not his finest moment and his attempt to normalize relations with cuba didn t work out so well for members of our us embassy who have now been diagnosed with brain abnormalities  after experiencing some sort of attack that many experts suspect was inflicted with a sonic weapon the left rejoiced when president barack obama decided to normalize relations with the cuban regime reopened our embassy and allowed travel to the islandbut most of that has come to a screeching halt after mysterious attacks on our diplomats which have caused serious health problems the state department has decided to recall all nonessential personnel from the embassy and urged americans not to travel to cuba legal insurrectionthe leftist boston globe publication gushed over barack obama s historic visit to cubawhen president obama travels to cuba on sunday with his family he is making a vital foreign policy statement and not just about the small island off the tip of florida the bigger principle at play is the value of diplomatic engagement over isolation cooperation versus cold war thinking the visit the first time a sitting american president has been to cuba in almost 90 years is a manifestation of the hope that democratic ideals can spread over time once normalized relations are establishedobama will not only be meeting with president raul castro but also with middleclass cubans entrepreneurs and political dissidents a symbolic yet reassuring move on behalf of democracy and fairness already the opening of relations is bearing fruit with new businesses sprouting and a flourishing tourism industry taking rootlegal insurrection the attacks on american officials at the us embassy in havana cuba keeps getting stranger and stranger the latest information revealed that doctors have found brain abnormalities in the victims from the associated pressit s the most specific finding to date about physical damage showing that whatever it was that harmed the americans it led to perceptible changes in their brains the finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involvedmedical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate several us officials said describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks white matter acts like information highways between brain cellssome of the victims woke up in the middle of the night and heard disembodied chirping in the room or a strange low hum or the sound of scraping metal others described how they felt a phantom flutter of air pass by as they listened there are some victims that did not notice anythingbut the victims felt the effects of these noises or nonnoises 24 hours later these symptoms included nausea loss of hearing or sight headaches vertigo and dizziness symptoms appeared to have gone away once the victims came back to america at first officials and doctors believed a sonic weapon caused the issues now they don t knowthe officials did not say if the doctors found these changes in all of the victims elisa konofagou a columbia university biomedical engineering professor told the ap that acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain s white matter tracts and she would be very surprised if that is the cause of the abnormalitiesfrom the washington post physicians are treating the symptoms like a new neverseenbefore illness the ap wrote and expect to monitor the victims for the rest of their lives although most have fully recovered from their symptoms by nowthe physicians are working with fbi agents and intelligence agencies as they look for a source and us officials have not backed down from their accusations against the cuban government which denies any involvement despite a history of animosity between the two countriesin october experts provided the mysterious noise to the ap it s high pitched almost like nails on a chalkboard they do not know what kind of mechanism produced this sound or who developed it those who heard a sound heard the same thingyet the ap has reviewed several recordings from havana taken under different circumstances and all have variations of the same highpitched sound individuals who have heard the noise in havana confirm the recordings are generally consistent with what they heard that s the sound one of them saidas the number of affected have risen the state department had no choice but to take action to protect our people secretary of state rex tillerson decided in late september to bring home all nonessential personnel from the us embassy in havana thus cutting the staff by 60 and halt citizen travel to the islanda few days later tillerson decided to expel 15 diplomats from the cuban embassy in washington dcinstead of a legacy of a great man who built muchneeded bridges with legitimate foreign nations barack hussein obama the community

attorney gloria allred used as proof of her accusations against us senate candidate roy mooreand in yet another blow to the credibility of abc news the disgraced leftwing network downplayed the

not come at a better time for moore nelson and allred are planning a news conference friday but nothing will overcome the forgery admissionhow can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing early reports are that nelson and allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery so a proven forger is bringing in her own expert what an insult to the people of alabamaanother problem with nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge as a circuit judge moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce casethe moore campaign has been pressuring nelson and allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignoredwith nelson now thoroughly discredited this leaves two accusers against mooreone is leigh corfman who claims moore molested her as a 14yearold child she is the most credible of the three but the narrative behind her story that moore s abuse resulted in corfman s living a troubled life of drinking drugs boyfriends and a suicide attempt is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court recordsmoore s final accuser is tina johnson a woman who claims moore groped her butt in his office in 1991 but again as was the case with corfman and nelson the leftwing media outlets reporting these allegations the washington post alcom either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial contextthanks to new media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting we now know that johnson did not tell the entire truth she was not in moore s office on business if she was in moore s office at all it was due to a bitter custody battle where moore represented johnson s mother who was trying to gain custody of johnson s 12yearold son based on the claim that johnson was an unfit absent and unstable mother if the media and the accusers and gloria allred told the full truth to begin with they would all be more crediblehere are

recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel as a way to get votesin 1999 while campaigning for new york s us senate seat first lady hillary rodham clinton said in a letter that she considered jerusalem to be the eternal and indivisible capital of israel and will be an active advocate if elected to new york s senate seat to move the us embassy to jerusalemin a letter that became public thursday mrs clinton wrote if i am chosen by new yorkers to be their senator or in whatever position i find myself in the years to come you can be sure that i will be an active committed advocate for a strong and secure israel able to live in peace with its neighbors with the united states embassy located in its capital jerusalem hillary s not the only one to promise that if elected they would move heaven and earth to make jerusalem the rightful capital of israel as it turns out bill clinton george w bush and barack obama twice also made the same promise the only problem is none of them had the courage to do itwatchwhen president realdonaldtrump announced that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel he fulfilled another campaign promise in addition to those that go back 25 years  pictwittercomp7m2dex2qt dan scavino jr danscavino december 7 2017here s why our courageous president donald trump was right to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israelmatthew continetti of the washington free beacon wrote the best article on trump s bold decision to move the us embassy to jerusalem that we have seen to datenot only is president trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and begin the process of moving the us embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency it is one of the boldest moves any us president has made since the beginning of the oslo peace process in 1993 that process collapsed at camp david in 2000 when yasir arafat rejected president clinton s offer of a palestinian state and the process has been moribund ever since despite multiple attempts to restart itthat is why the warnings from trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow there is no peace process to wreck the conflict is frozen and the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in us or israeli policy but in palestinian autocracy corruption and incitement have the former obama administration officials decrying trump s announcement read a newspaper lately from listening to them you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the middle east but for trump in fact the region is engulfed in war terrorism poverty and despotism israel faces threats in the north and south its sworn enemy iran is growing in influence and reach and the delegitimization of the jewish state proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses i forget how the obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world maybe someone will remind meone of the reasons the middle east persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been for decades a playground of magical thinking whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the ayatollah khamenei is a goodfaith partner whether it is imagining that assad will go just because we tell him to or that isis is akin to a terrorist jv team liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the middle east that is much more flattering than the actuality a similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over jerusalem every israeli knows jerusalem was is and will remain his capital every recent president has agreed with him and the us consensus has been bipartisan the last four democratic platforms have said the obvious that jerusalem is israel s capital the senate voted 900 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote was it all virtuesignaling a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of us diplomacyit is a sign of the disingenuousness of american foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning president trump has no background in or admiration for the routines manners and norms of the us foreign service especially that part of it which specializes in the israelipalestinian conflict this has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid jerusalem is israel s capital full stop his transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition in march 2016 at the aipac policy conference he pledged that we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people jerusalem his remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the proisrael communityi wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of us law as disruptive have they not paid attention to this man donald trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the us capital for decades in this sense his jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm he is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion what trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one by keeping his campaign promise today he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the united states could have its cake and eat it too on the question of israel s capital and by moving our embassy to jerusalem the united states will acknowledge israel s right to determine its own capital city that is not something to condemn or fear it is something to be proud of,left-news,6-Dec-17,0

‘Classified’ Emails from Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin found on Anthony Weiner’s Laptop,looking back on the 2016 presidential election there was a nonstop chorus on denials by hillary clinton her campaign surrogates and the mainstream media that had not allowed any classified emails to float around her homebrew server or onto the family of her close aidsas it turns out hillary clinton was lying a new batch of emails released by the us state department clearly show that anthony weiner convicted sex criminal and husband of clinton s chief aid huma abedin had kept classified emails pertaining to official us state department business during hillary clinton s tenure as secretary of state kept on the same laptop which weiner used to target an underage girl and where he also kept child pornographyamong the released emails were exchanges which clearly show hillary clinton conspiracy with authoritarian saudi arabia to stop wikileaks the reopening of this old clinton gaping wound is another devastating blow for the mainstream media and the democratic party s resistance movement whose mission is to remove donald trump for officert international reports at least five of the 2800 emails stored on a laptop belonging to former democratic congressman anthony weiner were marked confidential and involved delicate talks with middle eastern leaders and hillary clinton s top aideon friday the state department released a batch of around 2800 workrelated documents from the email account of huma abedin who served as the deputy chief of staff to former secretary of state hillary clintonat least five of the emails found on abedin s exhusband s laptop were heavily redacted and marked classified and at confidential level the third more sensitive class the us government uses below secret and top secret the state department applies the confidential classification level to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security according to the government publishing officewhile the documents were not marked as classified before they were released some of the information recovered in the emails was considered classified it is illegal for civilians to posses or read classified documents without a security clearancethe confidential emails which date from 2010 to 2012 concern discussions with middle eastern leadersdishonest despite being caught multiple times hillary clinton is still in denial about mishandling classified materialone of the emails has the subject egyptian mfa on hamasplo talks referring to the palestine liberation organization the email is mostly redacted only mentioning that it is a further update on hamaspa talks referring to the palestinian authorityanother fourpage email contains a completely redacted call sheet to prepare clinton for an upcoming call with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahua call sheet in another 2010 email includes notes to guide clinton through a call she would make to saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal the purpose of the call was to inform saud about an impending wikileaks disclosure this appears to be the result of an illegal act in which a fully cleared intelligence officer stole information and gave it to a website the person responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law the call sheet instructed clinton to sayclinton was warning the saudis the leak could contain information related to private conversations with your government on iraq iran and afghanistan and asked the saudi s to help the us prevent wikileaks from undermining our mutual interests during a congressional hearing in 2016 former fbi director james comey said abedin regularly forwarded emails to weiner for him to print out for her so she could deliver them to the secretary of state the emails were released in response to a 2015 lawsuit filed by conservative watchdog group judicial watch against the state department after it failed to respond to a freedom of information request foia seeking all emails of official state department business received or sent by former deputy chief of staff huma abedin from january 1 2009 through february 1 2013 using a non stategov email address in a statement issued friday judicial watch president tom fitton called the release a major victory adding that it was no

specialist 2nd class eric zeak published at wikicommons21st century wire says while military forces are fighting one enemy in the theatre of combat another multifront culture war is also being fought within their institutions according to a recent report in militarycom us military lawyers have begun speaking about how sexual assault cases are flooding the military courts threatening to break the back of the military s legal system and perhaps radically alter the institutional cultureafter the release of the documentary the invisible war the issue of sexual assault in the military has again been thrust into the national spotlight claiming that 1 in 5 us female veterans have sustained some form of sexual assaultthe issue of sexual assault in the us military first rose to national prominence in 1992 with the emergence of the infamous tailhook scandal one likely reason for this new spike in reported cases could be because each military service branch has recently implemented new awareness programs as well as sexual assault prevention campaigns which actively encourage female troops to report anything they might feel constitutes sexual harassment or a constitutes a sexual assaultthis also comes at a time where the us military has undergone the gradual process of becoming more gay friendly in order to advance issues of equality and to cater for its growing ranks of lgbt service men and womenmilitarycom explains how the new liberal progressive agenda may be adversely affecting operations military lawyers said the pentagon leadership has the right intentions but these prevention campaigns have flooded military court rooms with so many sexual assault cases it s made it harder to prosecute guilty sexual predatorsprosecutors lack witnesses or strong evidence in the majority of cases making it hard to yield a conviction said michael waddington a military defense lawyer and former judge advocate in the army he sees too many cases that involve alcohol and depend on hearsaythe military has the resources to take many sexual assault cases to court said philip cave a military defense lawyer and retired navy lawyer waddington estimated that ninety percent of the sexual assault cases taken to courtmartial would be thrown out in a civilian court because of a lack of evidenceas a result the military are now trying various other different initiatives to try and cope with a problem which to have spun out of controlrt international reports promoting empathy and cracking down on hypermasculinity may help the department of defense to reduce unwanted sexual behavior and improve combat readiness a new government report on sexual violence in the military saysunwanted sexual behaviors such as sexual harassment sexual assault and domestic violence undermine core values unit cohesion combat readiness and public goodwill says the report published this month by the government accountability office gao and signed by brenda farrell director of defense capabilities and managementthe report pointed out that interconnected inappropriate behaviors are part of a continuum of harm that creates a climate conducive to sexual harassment assault and violence the national defense authorization act ndaa for fiscal year 2017 expanded the definition of sexual harassment in the military beyond sex discrimination to make it an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault both the pentagon and the separate service branches have yet to update their policies to reflect this new definition the gao foundthe report also urged the pentagon to incorporate the guidelines for preventing and dealing with sexual violence developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdcthe pentagon is ignoring risk factors identified by the cdc such as alcohol and drug use hypermasculinity emotionally unsupportive family environments general tolerance of sexual violence within the community and societal norms that support male superiority and sexual entitlement the report saysnewport ri oct 29 2010 gunnery sgt duncan hurst encourages an officer candidate to properly perform

actions affect others cdc s research has also established that survivors of one form of violence are more likely to be victims of other forms of violence that survivors of violence are at higher risk for behaving violently and that people who behave violently are more likely to commit other forms of violence the gao report notes apparently seeking to make a distinction between violence in authorized military conflict and personal violencenoting that the dod instructed the services in 2014 to develop mechanisms for reporting incidents of sexual harassment anonymously the gao said that such mechanisms are not yet part of the departmentwide sexual violence policiesadditionally each service branch uses a different database format to record formal complaints of sexual harassment the navy uses excel spreadsheets for example while the gao does not go as far as to recommend a single database the report does advocate improving and standardizing data collection so that the department of defense can further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted sexual behaviors having a single standard across service branches would also be helpful the gao report says noting that the us marine corps usmc updated its standards of conduct in may the usmc made the change in response to the marines united scandal where current and former members posted nude photos of female recruits in a facebook group along with disparaging comments while the marines now consider posting nude photos of others without consent to be harassment other service branches do not as of yetthe

The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil, dr can erimtan 21st century wiredid donald j trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world did he have any idea that the whole wide world including the united nations would turn against himon wednesday 6 december 2017 in the white house s diplomatic reception room the president of the united states proceeded to make history or proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise they failed to deliver today i am delivering in his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement trump explained that in 1995 under bill clinton s watch that is congress adopted the jerusalem embassy act urging the federal government to relocate the american embassy to jerusalem and to recognize that that city and so importantly is israel s capital this act passed congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the senate only six months ago in this way the 45th us president showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed as he uttered words that neither bill clinton nor george w bush or more importantly perhaps barack obama had dared speakyes trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name in spite of the vehemently proisrael stance taken by the us ever since the time of president eisenhower 195361 and particularly ever since the six day war 510 june 1967 in spite of the ceaseless activities of aipac and j street no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide us embassy to jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the new world and the promised land only donald j trump had the gall to deliver doing what clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise    until now that isin true aristotelian fashion trump took the potentiality that was jerusalem known as al quds or the sacred city in the muslim world and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city following these presidential words outspoken israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the white house mark regev the erstwhile spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs in jerusalem 20047 and frequent israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media and currently even active as israeli ambassador in london since 2015 blurted out that he thinks this was a just move and a good move for peace his boss bibi or benjamin netanyahu fourth premiership 2015 present was equally forthcoming talking to the press on the same day the us president made his performance in the diplomatic reception room thank you president trump for today s historic decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital the jewish people and the jewish state will be forever grateful the pm in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words declaring that there is no peace that doesn t include jerusalem as the capital of israel the idea that jerusalem should be at the heart of the jewish people s land and nation namely has its roots in the bible in 2 chronicles 656 to be precise since the day i brought my people out of egypt i have not chosen a city in any tribe of israel to have a temple built so that my name might be there nor have i chosen anyone to be ruler over my people israel but now i have chosen jerusalem for my name to be there and i have chosen david to rule my people israel as worded in the new international version and bibi knows that toobibi even took his words of praise abroad first to paris where he met with president emmanuel macron who had urged his us counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to trump s diplomatic reception room performance 10 december 2017 bibi disagreed volubly with the frenchman characterising as absurd anyone not willing to recognise the millennial connection of the jewish people to jerusalem next even proceeding to refer to god s word that had elevated jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple you can read it in a very fine book it s called the bible the following day he went to brussels where he attended a meeting of eu foreign ministers 11 december 2017 the israeli pm told the gathered eu fm as well as the assembled press corps that trump s jerusalem declaration makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace the foundation of peace the invention of the jewish people and the position of jerusalem in islamthe state of israel as a jewish nation state implanted on middle eastern soil in 1948 employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence the israeli journalist and author daniel gavron for example states that most israelis regard it as axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3000th anniversary of the conquest of jerusalem by king david in 1995 marked a real and tangible event even though he himself doubts its authenticity in other words the jewish people as a shorthand for the israeli citzenry have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by bibi for quite a while but as i explained at length some time ago the mere mention of the term nation or even just people is a problematic issue in its own right the point that i am trying to get across is that nations or people cannot be perceived as natural or even organic phenomena but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger artificial whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures leaders of men and their organisations it has been nearly ten years now that the historian schlomo sand published his groundbreaking text the invention of the jewish people which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like benedict anderson and ernst gellner amongst others but as seems blatantly apparent from looking at bibi s recent proclamations his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble in spite of having topped israeli bestseller list for nineteen weeks with regard to the city of jerusalem on the other hand archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the site has been continuously occupied for some 5000 years signalling the urban centre s prejewish roots but the notion that king david conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky gavron explains that the biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have and in the opinion of most modern scholars the bible is not an entirely reliable historical document still archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain david indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century bce namely a small triangular piece of basalt rock    subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of syria and later smashed by an israelite ruler carrying an aramaic inscription talking about a beit david  house or dynasty of david  but the jewish conquest of jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover andor occupation remaining in ancient times the assyrian king sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 bce whereas the babylonian nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign 598 bce but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of titus son of the roman emperor vespasian 70 ce in response to the jews great revolt against rome that had sprung up in 66 ce the ultimate outcome of rome s harsh response was the diaspora as explained by the american rabbi lecturer and author joseph telushkin who estimates that as many as one million jews died as a result while carrying in its wake the almost twothousandyear span of jewish homelessness and exile with the majority of jews apparently dispersed from the land and city jerusalem was eventually conquered by the caliph umar reign 63444 in the year 638 an event which seems to have taken place following a peaceful siege no blood was shed in the words of zia h shah a new yorkbased physician and the chief editor of the muslim times the addition of jerusalem to the dar alislam or the abode of islam was important though the city s name does not appear specifically in the quran containing only a reference to almasjid al aqsa or the furthest mosque 171 it is the locus of the prophet s miraculous night journey or mi raj the story as related in various prophetic traditions or hadith tells how the figure of the prophet travelled from makkah to the furthest mosque in jerusalem from whence he ascended heaven so that allah might show him of our signs as a result the masjid al aqsa arguably built by the caliph umar though no historical records exist to this effect is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in islam following the masjid alharam in makkah and al masjid annabawi in madinaha pseudoottoman gambit diverting attention for a purposeas a result donald trump s diplomatic reception room stunt far supersedes the thorny palestinian issue the lifeanddeath matter of peace in the middle east or even the real estate division between east and west jerusalem the englishlanguage panarab television channel al jazeera english matteroffactly point out on its website that violence protests and arrests have followed us president donald trump s decision to recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel all across the globe muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of trump s latest attempt to act like a real president a president unlike any of his predecessors rallies against trump s decision also took place in the indian city of mumbai the malaysian capital kuala lumpur and the japanese capital tokyo but also in turkey where president recept tayyip erdo an aka the prez has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the ottoman sultans of old after all sultan selim i 151220 took hold of the city of jerusalem in 1517 remaining part of the ottoman fold till the onset of the british mandate 191748 on thursday and friday 78 december 2017 spontaneous meetings took place throughout the whole of the country from istanbul over bursa ankara and mersin to hatay gaziantep tatvan adana van and kahramanmara  more importantly the 57member organisation of islamic cooperation oic held a meeting in istanbul on 13 december 2017 and the prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of islam defying not just the united states of america and israel but also the kingdom of saudi arabia the nominal custodian of the two holy mosques as i have written quite some time ago the prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally king salman and see himself as the rightful calip of the world of islam in true pseudoottoman fashionthe oic meeting dutifully released its istanbul declaration on freedom for al quds  appreciating the republic of turkey and the turkish people for hosting the extraordinary islamic summit regarding this important cause of ummah especially the call for this extraordinary summit made by his excellency recep tayyip erdo an image left president of the republic of turkey    we reject and condemn the us administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of al quds    just like the fact that israel s decision to annex al quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience justice and history we invite all members of the un the eu and the international community to remain committed to the status of al quds and all related un resolutions rather than accomplishing anything much at all the extraordinary oic meeting primarily served to heighten tayyip erdo an s prestige at home as well as abroad as such a cynic would say that trump s timing was impeccable as 1725 december marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as akpgate that erupted in 2013 and that presently was very much on people s minds in turkey given that the turkishiranian businessman reza zarrab or r za sarraf in turkish was appearing in court in new york the court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon iran and many turks eagerly followed the proceedings on twitter one istanbulbased writer kareem shaheen described the accusations as follows in a case that has strained relations between turkey and the us reza zarrab a turkishiranian gold trader described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme he told jurors in new york on thursday 30 november 2017 that tayyip erdo an who was prime minister of turkey at the time had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of iran zarrab said he had also bribed the then turkish economy minister zafer a layan and the former head of the stateowned halkbank as a result given that the zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire turcoamerican relationship trump s jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for erdogan the decision to recognise jerusalem as israel s capital finally absolved the erdogan from any attempts to salvage the crossatlantic relationship and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the republic of turkey is now the rightful heir to the ottoman empire and the only hope left for muslims across the world muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive us foreign policy and putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent erdo an announced on thursday 17 december 2017 that he would establish a turkish embassy in jerusalem representing ankara in palestine to be clear speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of karaman the prez declared god willing the day is close when officially with god s permission we will open our embassy there in jerusalemall the while the palestinian people continue to suffer and israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the gaza strip and crack down on palestinian protesters but trump has done his deed leaving his indelible mark on the middle east while the prez in turn

Bundy Case Ruled a Mistrial – Will Federal Case Soon Crumble?,mark anderson 21st century wirethe greek philosopher plato was credited with saying justice in the life and conduct of the state is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens well since longtime nevada rancher cliven bundy his sons and his other compatriots have demonstrated they possess a strong sense of principles and justice perhaps a little justice in the life of the american state is possible which is no small thing in an age of nearly universal tyranny and injusticethis welcome ray of light became apparent in las vegas on dec 20 when us district judge gloria navarro declared a mistrial in the current highprofile proceedings involving cliven his sons ryan and ammon and ryan paynethis prompted members of the bundy family and dozens of their supporters to leave the courthouse on that tuesday in a state of elation even with the presence of protesters who holding signs that read keep your bundy hands off public lands appeared to be paid agitators for billionaire leftist revolutionary george soros as one protestor basically admittedback in the spring of 2014 the abovenamed four defendants who ve become emblematic of the plight of western ranchers resisting heavyhanded federal land controls were accompanied by other bundy siblings and by scores of supporters from across the nation all of whom gathered near cliven s ranch in clark county in southern nevada to exercise their first and second amendment rightson that basis these brave souls some of whom were armed in an opencarry state protested the actions of wellarmed bureau of land management agents fbi agents including swat units and contractors when these officials showed up set up shop and finally moved to impound cliven s cattle over flimsy allegations of unpaid grazing fees on public lands the impoundment attempt on april 12 2014 was unsuccessful howeverbut while the government retreated that day after a lengthy and often tense standoff a 16count federal indictment was eventually handed down cliven ammon and the two ryans were among nearly 20 initially indicted in this nowlegendary federal case which hasn t gone particularly well for prosecutors ever since the first of several planned trials started in february of 2017thus the government despite spending millions of dollars has seen its case steadily deflate to the point where as of now the only things that remain according to a legal observer are for judge navarro to receive briefs from the prosecution and the defense by 5 pm dec 29 when a hearing may take place those briefs will consist of arguments to enable the judge to decide whether or not to fully dismiss the casethe mistrial happened around 930 am pacific time dec 20 as navarro told the jury to go home    it s over recounted roger roots a legal expert and author who has observed virtually every trial proceeding firsthandhe said that after judge navarro reviews the briefs an open hearing will be convened at 9 am on jan 8 according to the court schedule as of this writing if she rules for dismissal jan 8 without prejudice the indictment remains in force and federal prosecutors technically could reset the trial of cliven and the three others reportedly on or around feb 26 but if she rules for dismissal with prejudice then the indictment is dissolved according to rootsroots said a dissolved indictment would mean the government would have to go to the trouble and expense of convening a new grand jury in order to seek a new indictment which would be double jeopardy and therefore a probable constitutional violationand while roots said the government conceivably could appeal the mistrial ruling to the ninth circuit at this point he does not believe the government would jump through all the necessary hoops for a new indictmentnotably what helped make the mistrial a reality was navarro s findings reached during hearings on exculpatory evidence that the government has been withholding that the prosecution had committed several brady v maryland violations including not disclosing to the defense the existence of surveillance cameras including those trained at the bundy homesteadalso included is not disclosing the fact that concealed snipers were stationed around the area at the time of the 2014 standoff not disclosing the existence of maps of the snipers positions and among other things not disclosing threatassessment reports which include government admissions that cliven and company are not dangerous peoplesee also nevada residents public land belongs to the people not dc notably family patriarch cliven as a matter of principle stayed in prison despite a recent hearing in which the court allowed him to leave jail under house arrest he has been jailed since early 2016 and has suffered from health problemscliven based his decision on the fact that a few remaining defendants which had included his sons mel and dave until they too were granted house arrest are still in jail awaiting a final trial that s been scheduled to take place sometime next year moreover ryan and ammon bundy as well as ryan payne all were recently released under housearrest rulings after an equally grueling amount of time behind barsduring a recent ontheair interview cliven s daughterinlaw briana who s mel s wife told free speech zone host jim lambley of ksdzfm the twister out of nebraska that in the almost two years that cliven has been behind bars several more grandchildren of his were born yet cliven despite such a strong emotional attachment to his large family still chose to remain in jail to honor the others still imprisonedon a dec 20 appearance on the same radio show briana added over 3300 hundred pages of evidence that could ve helped the defense have been withheld and have been turned over to the defense in the last two weeks     it was absolutely intentional and she judge navarro said she believes it was intentional because of what they withheld briana who understands that even one let alone several brady violations normally would be expected to lead to a full dismissal of the case right away rather than carrying on with more hearings added however that the bundy siblings all are wearing electronic ankle bracelets and cannot leave their housearrest locations before 7 am and must return by 7 pm even while they are prohibited from congregating during christmastime but we re still winning here briana went on to tell ksdz host jim lambley while adding that even though a dismissal was hopedfor rather than a mistrial the upside is that any further proceedings will provide an opportunity to expose even more evidence that the government has withheldlambley replied the government is just digging a deeper hole for themselves the government is the false accuser here that s all there is to it mr roots who s cautiously optimistic about the remainder of this case said that given the mistrial ruling the few defendants still behind bars have a dramatically improved chance of never going to trial cliven won t go home until this case is all the way over roots remarked moved by cliven

"Trump Team Didn’t Just Collude with Israel, Kushner was Acting as Foreign Agent for Tel Aviv",patrick henningsen 21st century wiremuch was made this week in the us media about michael flynn s recent guilty plea to making false statements to the fbi as part of special counsel robert mueller s neverending russia probe beyond the political window dressing however there s a much bigger and more profound story lingering in the background although court documents show flynn has admitted to giving false statements in reference to his reaching out to russia s ambassador to the us sergey kislyak the mere act of initiating contact with any foreign official is neither illegal nor is it a violation of ethics putting the current red scare aside this would normally be viewed as standard statecraft for members of any incoming us administration even if flynn had promised the russian ambassador as claimed this week by resistance leader rep elijah e cummings of maryland that a trump government would ripup sanctions such a promise by flynn would not be unlawful anyone can make a promise we should point out here that neither flynn nor donald trump would be in any position to make good on such a promise without the blessing of the us congress and senate just look at what happened when trump took office were any sanctions liftedthat said after 18 months of fabricating fake news about russian hacking russian meddling and russian collusion it s not surprising that the new york times would get the flynn story wrong too and on an even bigger scale than many of their past madeup stories about trump scandals here we have yet another handwringing resistance writer harry litman claiming that flynn s testimony will go down in history next to watergate and irancontra the repercussions of the plea will be months in the making but it s not an exaggeration to say that the events to which mr flynn has agreed to testify will take their place in the history books alongside the watergate and irancontra scandals he might be right if only the media coverage and the federal hearing would focus on the correct country with whom the trump team was colluding which unfortunately was not russia funny how partisan writer litman did not even mention the word israel once in his report perhaps this is why certain persons in washington like adam schiff chuck schumer john mccain and others along with their corrupt media counterparts like cnn the washington post and the new york times have been incessantly pushing their fictional russia did it narrative for the last 18 months because russiagate serves as a convenient overlay for israelgatemehdi hassan from the intercept writes why aren t more members of congress or the media discussing the trump transition team s pretty brazen collusion with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to undermine both us government policy and international law shouldn t that be treated as a major scandal thanks to mueller s ongoing investigation we now know that prior to president donald trump s inauguration members of his inner circle went to bat on behalf of israel and specifically on behalf of illegal israeli settlements in the occupied palestinian territories behind the scenes and in opposition to official us foreign policy that s the kind of collusion with a foreign state that has gotten a lot of attention with respect to the kremlin but colluding with israel seems to be of far less interest strangely yes you heard that right this was at minimum collusion with israel but it goes much deeper than that if this story is accurate and we have every reason to believe it is especially by the large silence in the american media usually a positive indication of media avoidance this would indicate that the then presidentelect s close advisor and soninlaw jared kushner was clearly acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the state of israel the fact the us media are not taking this story more seriously should serve as a reminder as to how much power the israeli lobby wields in the us not just over politicians but over mainstream media as well granted this is a very serious charge which comes with some serious consequences if kushner would ever be indicted but the facts clearly demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that then presidentelect s soninlaw was using his proximity to the incoming commander and chief to execute a series of highly sensitive foreign policy maneuvers at the request of a foreign countrythe history of israeli spying and outright meddling in us affairs is no secret to anyone willing to research it unofficially a forbidden topic in us mainstream media but this latest episode with trump and kushner is even more disturbing considering this week s controversial east jerusalem announcement 21wire warned about an east jerusalem provocation 12 months agobeyond this many will argue that the radical fundamentalist zionist agenda which kushner is aggressively pursuing on behalf of tel aviv is not in the interest of the wider middle east nor is it good for america s european partners and may even contribute to a further destablization of the region as evidenced by recent violence which has erupted following trump s provocative move the result is not necessarily in america s interests even if it is certainly in israel s interestsauthor mehdi hassan continueshere s what we learned last week when mueller s team unveiled its plea deal with trump s former national security adviser retired gen michael flynn in december 2016 the united nations security council was debating a draft resolution that condemned israeli settlement expansion in the occupied territories as a flagrant violation under international law that was dangerously imperiling the viability of an independent palestinian statethe obama administration had made it clear that the us was planning to abstain on the resolution while noting that the settlements have no legal validity and observing how the settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is now putting at risk the twostate solution rhetorically at least us opposition to israeli settlements has been a longstanding and bipartisan position for decades ronald reagan called for a real settlement freeze in 1982 while george hw bush tried to curb israeli settlementbuilding plans by briefly cutting off us loan guarantees to the jewish state in 1991everyone expected that the upcoming un vote on illegal israeli settlements was going to be a divisive issue but with only weeks before trump s fast approaching inauguration israel had its trojan horse in position hassan goes on to explain tel aviv s covert mechanism for manipulating the un vote on or about december 22 2016 a very senior member of the presidential transition team directed flynn to contact officials from foreign governments including russia to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution reads the statement of offense against flynn who pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations with the russian ambassador to the us on or about december 22 2016 flynn contacted the russian ambassador about the pending vote flynn informed the russian ambassador about the incoming administration s opposition to the resolution and requested that russia vote against or delay the resolution bffs donald trump talks to his chief foreign policy advisor israeli president benjamin netanyahuso who was this very senior member of trump s team who sought to execute orders from the office of israeli president benjamin netanyahu hassan explainswho was the very senior member of the transition team who directed flynn to do all this multiple news outlets have confirmed that it was jared kushner trump s soninlaw and main point man on the middle east peace process jared called flynn and told him you need to get on the phone to every member of the security council and tell them to delay the vote a trump transition official revealed to buzzfeed news on friday adding that kushner told flynn this was a top priority for the president according to buzzfeed after hanging up flynn told the entire room at the trump transition team hq that they d have to start pushing to lobby against the un vote saying the president wants this done asap flynn s guilty plea buzzfeed continued revealed for the first time how trump transition officials solicited russia s help to head off the un vote and undermine the obama administration s policy on middle east peace before ever setting foot in the white house even during the height of the neocon era with multiple israeli loyalists in the cabinet including some dual passport holders shaping white house middle east policy ultimately into a ditch with iraq the level of manipulation wasn t this overt trump s decision to reverse successive us administrations new policy on east jerusalem is inconceivable if not for some other xfactor which the pnacdominated george w bush could not even managethe facts of the case against kushner have not been contested and in fact kushner has even been gloating out on the speaking circuit with his doting wife ivanka proudly advertizing her husband s accomplishment on behalf israelmy husband jared kushner had a great conversation on the middle east with haim saban today at the saban forum saban17httpstcobubgfd1ynr ivanka trump ivankatrump december 4 2017 none of this has been contested in fact on sunday kushner made a rare public appearance at the saban forum in washington dc to discuss the trump administration s plans for the middle east and was welcomed by the forum s sponsor the israeliamerican billionaire haim saban who said he personally wanted to thank kushner for taking steps to try and get the united nations security council to not go along with what ended up being an abstention by the us kushner s response the first soninlaw smiled nodded and mouthed thank you to sabanmeanwhile the israelis have been pretty forthcoming about their own role in all of this too on monday ron dermer israel s ambassador to the us and a close friend and ally of netanyahu told politico s susan glasser that in december 2016 obviously we reached out to the trump transition team in the hope that they would help us and we were hopeful that they would speak to other governments in order to prevent this vote from happening got that the trump transition team in the form of key trump advisers kushner and flynn reached out to the russian government in order to undermine the us government because the israeli government asked them to according to these reports kushner was using his position in the transition team to act on israel s behalf outside of any governmental framework of accountability if flynn inadvertently found himself in a russian trap it was because israel and its inhouse operative demanded itif flynn is guilty of anything it would be going along with kushner s israel first scheme ahead of the united nations vote what is odd though is why the entire us mainstream media is not interested in this part of the story even the never trump resistance seem to be afraid of taking this narrative on i guess even the resistance has its limits rather than go for a case where the evidence is sitting right there on a silver salver instead they will go for the russian conspiracy theory alas old habits die hardsee also the genealogy of trump s uturn on palestinethis series of events is all the more pertinent when considering this week s announcement by president trump that the us is to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and will be moving its embassy from tel aviv to east jerusalem many are already calling this the kiss of death to the israelpalestine peace process in a predictable succession of events the jerusalem provocation was a fait accompli after trump had announced in october that the us would be withdrawing from support for unesco the un body which is meant to help maintain the neutrality of jerusalem as an internationally protected area the trump administration justified its resignation from the key un agency on the grounds that it is biased against israel but the neutrality of jerusalem is an essential policy for maintaining peace in a less than ideal situation with palestine still under a brutal military occupation by an illegitimate and illegal by international law and successive un resolutions israeli jackbootin addition to all this this past summer the united states announced the establishment of a permanent military installation inside of israel what s scary is how many people do not know this has happenedso trump s minence grise the wunderkind who some people have called the president inlaw is really israel s man inside the white houselanded on his feet president inlaw jared kushnerso what exactly are jared kushner s credentials in international relations and diplomacy that he has been charged with negotiating middle east affairs for the united states of america without sounding too cruel here it s difficult to find anything to say in his defense in the end his only visible qualification is that he s married to the president s daughter and that s he s a good friend of netanyahu that s really itcredit where credit s due though aside from marrying into the dynasty kushner is also the former owner of a mediocre website the new york observer and has also managed to parlay his family status to help finance a number of highprofile new york city property deals with foreign buyers no doubt with the help of his fatherinlawisn t that what kushner is doing right now using his inherited clout to help close friend benjamin netanyahu broker property deals highly illegal by international law in the middle east only this time with his uncle sam acting as the guarantor it certainly looks that way the question is will anyone in the us do anything about itwhen this latest episode of hubris by the white house and israel eventually unravels the public and the media might then turn on kushner and trump but by then the damage will have already been donemeanwhile men like jake tapper and wolf blitzer will still be chasing those illusive russian hackers clear into the 2020 election cycle which is probably a stupid move for the resistance but if the last 18 months have taught us anything it s that there isn t much clear thinking going on in that corner of the galaxyuntil then netanyahu can feel safe in the knowledge that israel not washington is currently in control

US Thanksgiving Guide: How to Celebrate a Sordid and Genocidal History, table set for thanksgiving in siem reap photo andre vltchekandre vltchek neoa table was set up for two an advertisement table a table with a photo of a giant turkey two elegant plates and a us flag sticking out into the air thanksgiving at angkor royal cafe  a flier read and 23rd november join us for a traditional thanksgiving feast this was at one of the international hotels in siem reap a cambodian city near the world architectural treasures of angkor wat and the ancient khmer capital angkor thomthe same day i read an email sent to me from the united states by my native american friends with a link to an essay published by mpn news called thanksgiving guide how to celebrate a sordid history  it began with a summary while millions of americans prepare this week to get into the holiday spirit beginning with thanksgiving how many are prepared to view the day through an accurate lens while to many americans the holiday serves as a reminder to give thanks it is seen as a day of mourning by countless of others the truth is european migrants brutally murdered native americans stole their land and continue to do so today  the day became an official day of festivities in 1637 to celebrate the massacre of over 700 people from the pequot tribein a hotel i approached a cheerful french food and beverage manager and asked him whether he was aware of what he was suggesting should be celebrated in one of his restaurants oh i know i know he replied laughing it is a little bit controversial isn t it bit controversial i wondered it appears more like you are inviting people to celebrate genocide a holocaust with free flowing wine and a giant turkey i am trying to see things positively he continued grinning at me then he summarized so i guess you won t be joining us tonight what a pity what a pity i thought what a pity i won t get to eat that famous american pie tonight and turkey and who knows what else just because i am not eager at all to celebrate the massacres and land grabs perpetrated by the empirethe manager couldn t help asking where are you from i knew he would ask no european would say what i was saying i m russian i replied oh i see he gave me that i should have guessed smile  russianamerican i addedi m convinced that the french manager has been sincerely oblivious about what i was stating he is supposed to be oblivious there are after all our genocides  and the genocides of the others  our genocides  those that we triggered or committed should never be discussed or more precisely it is extremely impolite to discuss them most of the people don t even know about them including many of the victims on the other hand the genocides committed by the others particularly by adversaries of the west are widely discussed publicized analyzed inflated and very often even fabricated all this described in detail in my 840page book exposing lies of the empire cambodia is the textbook case of the latter here several decades ago the us and its allies first supported the hopelessly corrupt and brutal government in phnom penh while triggering a monstrous carpetbombing campaign of the cambodian countryside mainly near the border with vietnam this was supposed to prevent the country from going communist  or at least ho chi minh style communist  hundreds of thousands of villagers were murdered by the bombing millions were forced to hit the road leaving their dwellings as the countryside was converted into a giant minefield covered by unexploded ordnancefurther hundreds of thousands died from starvation and diseases furious mad from suffering the people of cambodia rose against the collaborators with the west in phnom penh pol pot and his khmer rouge took the capital virtually unopposed recently deep in the jungle i spoke to the former pol pot s personal guards i asked them pointblank whether they knew anything about communism nothing at all i was told the us was murdering our families for no reason corrupt elites were selling the country to the west we were all outraged and ready for revenge we would follow anybody calling for revenge however the west is passing the events to this day as a communist genocide rwanda is yet another case of a twisted narrative i made an entire fulllength documentary film rwanda gambit on the subject there the west turned the history upside down reducing the entire tragedy into a primitive and easytodigest narrative of bad hutus killing good tutsis yet even the former us ambassador robert flatten told me that his country groomed armed and supported the deadly rpf mainly tutsi army which had been before 1994 raiding the rwandan countryside from neighboring uganda burning villages and killing civilianswhile a former australian lawyer and un investigator michael hourigan supplied me with information about the downing of the plane which in april 1994 killed both the rwandan president juvenal habyarimana and burundian president cyprien ntaryamira while on the final approach to kigali airport the orders to shoot down the plane were given by the rpf leader paul kagame who was in turn sponsored by the west this event triggered the terrible bloodletting on 1994 the next year in 1995 the rwandan army entered the democratic republic of congo drc and participated in the killing of at least 9 million people mainly civilians on behalf of western governments and multinational companies making it the worst crime against humanity in recent historyin fact almost all the major genocides committed by the west or its allies in modern history are silent ones  including those in iraq syria iran west papua east timor drc indonesia afghanistan angola and dozens of other unfortunate places all over the worldthe gruesome genocides committed by the west all over the world during the last 2000 but especially during the last 500 years are never defined as such never as genocides  throughout history european countries have been destroying systematically most of the cultures on all continents of the planet enslaving virtually all the nonwhite nations plundering and looting its colonies read almost all the nonwhite nations of the world while exterminating hundreds of millions of men women and children the death toll has been rising accumulating to near 1 billion according to the testimony of one of my friends a senior un statisticiani will return to the cambodian story soon on the pages of this magazine and i will be returning again and again to the genocides committed by europe and north america virtually everywhere unless the history is understood and acknowledged the world has no future and there can be no solutions to the terrible problems that our humanity is facingbut for now let me conclude this brief essay by saying that i did not participate in the consumption of turkey and american pies on thanksgiving holiday in the cambodian city of seam reapmy thoughts went to those 700 people from the pequot tribe who rebelled stood firm and died for freedom almost 400 years ago these were some of the first fighters against western imperialism these were the americans that i admire this is america that had been terribly damaged but not yet completely destroyed no overly sugary sentimental and empty words could fully choke its essence as no gluttony

Repeat Deceit: How US Tries to Link Iran to Al Qaeda,when it comes to interpreting current events no one does official conspiracy theories like the unite statesfor years washington has tried to promulgate a propaganda campaign which tries to somehow link al qaeda to iran or isis to iran for the mentallychallenged members of the rightwing media in the us this isn t a massive feat as a large segment of that audience cannot even locate iran on a global map there is also the issue of us warhawks like lindsey graham and john mccain being proven pathological liars who will say anything regardless of whether it s based in actual fact all of this contributes to a number of shallow creative narratives which continuously circulate between fox news the atlantic magazine tel aviv riyadh and the us senateand just like the us and uk mainstream media s coverage of syria the deep throat source in this dossier is al qaedathis latest chapter in the us fantasy world of iranian intrigue attempts to further the israelifavoured mythology blaming iran for all of the region s woes make no mistake the american neoconservative wing and their israeli benefactors are determined to invent new conditions for war with iran image bush s al qaeda no2 guy abu musab al zarqawigareth porter the american conservative for many years major us institutions ranging from the pentagon to the 911 commission have been pushing the line that iran secretly cooperated with al qaeda both before and after the 911 terror attacks but the evidence for those claims remained either secret or sketchy and always highly questionablein early november however the mainstream media claimed to have its smoking gun a cia document written by an unidentified al qaeda official and released in conjunction with 47000 neverbeforeseen documents seized from osama bin laden s house in abbottabad pakistanthe associated press reported that the al qaeda document appears to bolster us claims that iran supported the extremist network leading up to the september 11 terror attacks the wall street journal said the document provides new insights into al qaeda s relationship with iran suggesting a pragmatic alliance that emerged out of shared hatred of the united states and saudi arabia nbc news wrote that the document reveals that at various points in the relationship iran offered al qaeda help in the form of money arms and training in hezbollah camps in lebanon in exchange for striking american interests in the gulf implying that al qaeda had declined the offerformer obama national security council spokesman ned price writing for the atlantic went even further asserting that the document includes an account of a deal with iranian authorities to host and train saudial qaeda members as long as they have agreed to plot against their common enemy american interests in the gulf region but none of those media reports were based on any careful reading of the document s contents the 19page arabiclanguage document which was translated in full for the american conservative doesn t support the media narrative of new evidence of iranal qaeda cooperation either before or after 911 at allit provides no evidence whatsoever of tangible iranian assistance to al qaeda on the contrary it confirms previous evidence that iranian authorities quickly rounded up those al qaeda operatives living in the country when they were able to track them down and held them in isolation to prevent any further contact with al qaeda units outside irantaken by surprisewhat it shows is that the al qaeda operatives were led to believe iran was friendly to their cause and were quite taken by surprise when their people were arrested in two waves in late 2002 it suggests that iran had played them gaining the fighters trust while maximizing intelligence regarding al qaeda s presence in irannevertheless this account which appears to have been written by a midlevel al qaeda cadre in 2007 appears to bolster an internal al qaeda narrative that the terror group rejected iranian blandishments and were wary of what they saw as untrustworthiness on the part of the iranians the author asserts the iranians offered saudi al qaeda members who had entered the country money and arms anything they need and training with hezbollah in exchange for hitting american interests in saudi arabia and the gulf but there is no word about whether any iranian arms or money were ever actually given to al qaeda fighters and the author acknowledges that the saudis in question were among those who had been deported during sweeping arrests casting doubt over whether there was ever any deal in the offingthe author suggests al qaeda rejected iranian assistance on principle we don t need them he insisted thanks to god we can do without them and nothing can come from them but evil that theme is obviously important to maintaining organizational identity and morale but later in the document the author expresses deep bitterness about what they obviously felt was iranian doubledealing in 2002 to 2003 they are ready to playact he writes of the iranians their religion is lies and keeping quiet and usually they show what is contrary to what is in their mind  it is hereditary with them deep in their character the author recalls that al qaeda operatives were ordered to move to iran in march 2002 three months after they had left afghanistan for waziristan or elsewhere in pakistan the document by the way says nothing of any activity in iran before 911 he acknowledges that most of his cadres entered iran illegally although some of them obtained visas from the iranian consulate in karachiamong the latter was abu hafs al mauritani an islamic scholar who was ordered by the leadership shura in pakistan to seek iranian permission for al qaeda fighters and families to pass through iran or to stay there for an extended period he was accompanied by middle and lowerranking cadres including some who worked for abu musab al zarqawi the account clearly suggests that zarqawi himself had remained in hiding after entering iran illegallystrict conditionsabu hafs al mauratani did reach an understanding with iran according to the al qaeda account but it had nothing to do with providing arms or money it was a deal that allowed them to remain for some period or to pass through the country but only on the condition that they observe very strict security conditions no meetings no use of cell phones no movements that would attract attention the account attributes those restrictions to iranian fears of us retribution which was undoubtedly part of the motivation but it is clear iran viewed al qaeda as an extremist salafist security threat to itself as wellmost of the al qaeda visitors according to the al qaeda document settled in zahedan the capital of sistan and baluchistan province where the majority of the population are sunnis and speak baluchi they generally violated the security restrictions imposed by the iranians they established links with the baluchis who he notes were also salafists and began holding meetings some of them even made direct contact by phone with salafist militants in chechnya where a conflict was rapidly spiraling out of control saif aladel one of the leading al qaeda figures in iran at the time later revealed that the al qaeda fighting contingent under abu musab al zarqawi s command immediately began reorganizing to return to afghanistanwaves of arreststhe first iranian campaign to round up al qaeda personnel which the author of the documents says was focused on zahedan came in may or june 2002 no more than three months after they have had entered iran those arrested were either jailed or deported to their home countries the saudi foreign minister praised iran in august for having transferred 16 al qaeda suspects to the saudi government in junein february 2003 iranian security launched a new wave of arrests this time they captured three major groups of al qaeda operatives in tehran and mashad including zarqawi and other top leaders in the country according to the document saif al adel later revealed in a post on a proal qaeda website in 2005 reported in the saudiowned newspaper asharq alawsat that the iranians had succeeded in capturing 80 percent of the group associated with zarqawi and that it had caused the failure of 75 percent of our plan the anonymous author writes that the initial iran policy was to deport those arrested and that zarqawi was allowed to go to iraq where he plotted attacks on shia and coalition forces until his death in 2006 but then he says the policy suddenly changed and the iranians stopped deportations instead opting to keep the al qaeda senior leadership in custody presumably as bargaining chips yes iran deported 225 al qaeda suspects to other countries including saudi arabia in 2003 but the al qaeda leaders were held in iran not as bargaining chips but under tight security to prevent them from communicating with the al qaeda networks elsewhere in the region which bush administration officials eventually acknowledgedafter the arrests and imprisonment of senior al qaeda figures the al qaeda leadership became increasingly angry at iran in november 2008 unknown gunmen abducted an iran consular official in peshawar pakistan and in july 2013 al qaeda operatives in yemen kidnapped an iranian diplomat in march 2015 iran reportedly released five of the senior al qaeda in prison including said aladel in return for the release of the diplomat in yemenin a document taken from the abbottabad compound and published by west point s counterterrorism center in 2012 a senior al qaeda official wrote we believe that our efforts which included escalating a political and media campaign the threats we made the kidnapping of their friend the commercial counselor in the iranian consulate in peshawar and other reasons that scared them based on what they saw we are capable of to be among the reasons that led them to expedite the release of these prisoners there was a time when iran did view al qaeda as an ally it was during and immediately after the war of the mujahedin against soviet troops in afghanistan that of course was the period when the cia was backing bin laden s efforts as well but after the taliban seized power in kabul in 1996 and especially after taliban troops killed 11 iranian diplomats in mazarisharif in 1998 the iranian view of al qaeda changed fundamentally since then iran has clearly regarded it as an extreme sectarian terrorist organization and its sworn enemy what has not changed is the determination of the us national security state and the supporters of israel to maintain the myth of an enduring iranian support

History Lesson: America’s Renegade Warfare,nicolas j s davies consortium newsseventyseven million people in north and south korea find themselves directly in the line of fire from the threat of a second korean war the rest of the world is recoiling in horror from the scale of civilian casualties such a war would cause and the unthinkable prospect that either side might actually use nuclear weaponssince the first korean war killed at least 20 percent of north korea s population and left the country in ruins the us has repeatedly failed to follow through on diplomacy to establish a lasting peace in korea and has instead kept reverting to illegal and terrifying threats of war most significantly the us has waged a relentless propaganda campaign to discount north korea s legitimate defense concerns as it confronts the threat of a us war machine that has only grown more dangerous since the last time it destroyed north koreathe north has lived under this threat for 65 years and has watched iraq and libya destroyed after they gave up their nuclear weapons programs when north korea discovered a us plan for a second korean war on south korea s military computer network in september 2016 its leaders quite rationally concluded that a viable nuclear deterrent is the only way to guarantee their country s safetywhat does it say about the role the us is playing in the world that the only way north korea s leaders believe they can keep their own people safe is to develop weapons that could kill millions of americansthe changing face of warthe second world war was the deadliest war ever fought with at least 75 million people killed about five times as many as in the first world war when the slaughter ended in 1945 world leaders signed the united nations charter to try to ensure that that scale of mass killing and destruction would never happen again the un charter is still in force and it explicitly prohibits the threat or use of military force by any nationit was not just the scale of the slaughter that shocked the world s leaders into that brief moment of sanity in 1945 it was also the identities of the dead twothirds of the people killed in the second world war were civilians a drastic change from the first world war only a few decades earlier when an estimated 86 percent of the people killed were uniformed combatants the use of nuclear weapons by the united states raised the specter that future wars could kill an exponentially greater numbers of civilians or even end human civilization altogetherwar had become total war no longer fought only on battlefields between soldiers but between entire societies with ordinary people their homes and their lives now on the front line in the second world war fleets of warplanes deliberately bombed cities to dehouse civilian populations as british officials described their own bombing of germany as i write this george orwell wrote from london in 1941 highly civilized human beings are flying overhead trying to kill me submarines sank hundreds of merchant ships in an effort to starve their enemies into submission general carter clarke who was in charge of interpreting japanese intelligence for president truman said in a 1959 interview that japan surrendered because it faced mass starvation due to the sinking of its merchant shipping not because of the gratuitous us nuclear attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki it was estimated that 7 million more civilians would die of starvation if japan fought on until 1946 genocidal mass extermination campaigns killed civilians based only on their political affiliation or ethnicity under crossexamination by a young american prosecutor benjamin ferencz ss gruppenfuhrer dr otto ohlendorf explained patiently to a courtroom in nuremberg why he found it necessary for the preemptive defense of germany to order the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians he explained that even children had to be killed to prevent them too becoming enemies of germany when they grew up and found out what happened to their parentsdespite the un charter and international efforts to prevent war people in countries afflicted by war today still face the kind of total war that horrified world leaders in 1945 the main victims of total war in our modern world have been civilians in countries far removed from the safe havens of power and privilege where their fates are debated and decided yugoslavia afghanistan iraq somalia pakistan yemen libya syria ukraine there has been no legal or political accountability for the mass destruction of their cities their homes or their lives total war has not been prevented or even punished just externalizedbut thanks to billions of dollars invested in military propaganda and public relations and the corrupt nature of forprofit media systems citizens of the countries responsible for the killing of millions of their fellow human beings live in neartotal ignorance of the mass killing carried out in their name in these red zones around the worldpeople in everspreading war zones are living under the very conditions of total war that the world recoiled from at the end of the second world war like orwell in london in 1941 they hear highly civilized human beings flying overhead trying to kill them human beings who know nothing about them beyond the name of the city where they live and its strategic value in wars that offer them the victims nothing but death or destitutionin the case of drones the human beings trying to kill them from the other side of the world are so highly civilized that they can hop into cars and drive home to have dinner with their families at the end of their shifts while another team member efficiently takes over the joystick and carries on killingpeople in yemen syria iraq and libya have been subjected to hunger and starvation under sieges and naval blockades that are as brutally effective as german and american submarines were in world war two millions of people in yemen face an imminent danger of starvation under the usbacked naval blockade and saudi and emirati bombing of yemeni portsin retaliation for one missile fired at riyadh the saudi capital

"TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTER: Years Before ‘Soft Target’ Attack, Gunman Tried to Carry Out Death Threats on CIA Linked Air Force Base",shawn helton 21st century wire the gunman named in a mass shooting that was said to have killed 26 people at a small church outside of san antonio was convicted by the military several years before the tragic attack in 2012 this past week new information concerning the apparent first baptist church gunman 26yearold devin patrick kelley revealed that the previously convicted air force airman was already wellknown to authorities via his bad conduct discharge from the military in 2012 the recent acknowledgement in kelley s case history coupled with his unusually relaxed plea bargain deal has only prompted more questions from those concerned about the most recent highprofile mass shooting in americaaccording to officials the sutherland springs shooting at the first baptist church may have been caused by a domestic dispute involving kelley and his exmotherinlaw michelle shields however it turns out that shields was not present at church services on the morning of the mass shooting although her mother was named as one of the victimsa more precise motive in the deadly sutherland springs massacre has yet to be uncovered by authorities texas church shooting 8 years after the fort hood mass shooting the first baptist church attack raises big questions its also worth noting the recent church shooting echoes a scene in the 2015 hollywood film kingsman the secret service photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonthe texas church shooterwhile many in media have focused on the military s inability to log devin patrick kelley s domestic violence courtmartial case into a federal database a police report from 2012 revealed that the gunman named in the first baptist church shooting had been previously caught attempting to sneak firearms onto a cia linked military base in new mexico where he was stationed the el paso police report concluded that after kelley escaped the mental health facility believed to be peak behavioral health services center in santa teresa he sought to carry out death threats against his superiors at new mexico s holloman air force basea cbs affiliate from dallas further explained the church shooter s lengthy criminal background the information was contained in a police incident report after devin patrick kelley briefly escaped in june 2012 from a mental health facility in new mexico where he had been committed kprc television in houston first reported about the escape police in el paso texas where kelley was caught after the escape said in the report that an official of the mental health facility told them that kelley was a danger to himself and others the report says that kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms onto holloman air force base it also says that he was attempting to carry out death threats that kelley had made on his military chain of command moreover a fox news report just days ago revealed additional information concerning kelley s violent threats at holloman air force base former air force staff sgt jessika edwards told the new york times that kelley would shake with rage and vow to kill his superiors when he was assigned menial tasks as punishment for poor performance at one point edwards told the times she warned others in the squadron to go easy on kelley believing he was likely to come back and shoot up the place rather strangely former air force staff sgt edwards still kept in close contact with the criminally convicted and discharged logistical readiness airman stating that he asked her to be a job reference in 2015 shortly there after kelley allegedly became obsessed with the polarizing case involving charleston church shooter dylann roof church shooter what is the real motive in the first baptist church shooting image source nbcwashingtonthe shocking claims of death threats prior to the sutherland springs church shooting taking place raises questions not only about the criminally convicted shooter kelley who was accused of a slew of abusive behavior but also the military s handling of the gunman s wellknown history of violence from a prosecutorial standpointquestion how did kelley manage to get such a relaxed sentence considering he had several other major charges dropped including an additional incident where he allegedly pointed a loaded firearm at his wifefurthermore as the public and media are still bewildered over kelley s ability to legally purchase guns following his 2012 military conviction due to his prior violent abuse information concerning his alleged plot to kill military superiors has been completely underreported and by the looks of it may have even gone unpunishedaccording to official reports kelley was sentenced to a year s confinement reducing rank from an airman firstclass a1c to airman basic additionally after being convicted of crimes by a military court in 2012 he received a bad conduct discharge following an apparent plea dealthe ny times added the following details regarding the military court case prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with mr kelley including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wifehe was ultimately sentenced in november that year to 12 months confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank his final duty title was prisoner question did kelley s plea agreement also include the exclusion of charges concerning his alleged death threat plot against military superiors at the cia linked holloman air force basemoreover if that wasn t a part of the plea how was kelley not dishonorably discharged due to the severity of charges he faced from military superiorsalthough we ve been told this latest soft target shooting spree on american soil was carried out by yet another lone gunman there have also been questions raised concerning a shooter allegedly firing from the roof top down on to church parishioners belowwatch and listen to shooting survivor rosanne solis as she recounts what she witnessed during the first baptist church shooting  question is it also possible that solis saw multiple shooters at the first baptist church if not how did kelley swiftly move from the roof top location to ground level in a matter of a few minutes assuming the account told by solis is truethe sutherland springs mass shooting along with other highprofile active shooter incidents this year and year s past have once again predictably sparked sociopolitical hot button issues concerning gun reform background checks mental illness and ssri prescription drugs this is something that has prompted critics to consider that there might be even more to the storybelow is a cnn video report discussing the lengthy criminal background of the first baptist church gunman note the strong emphasis in this report regarding kelley s access to weaponry rather than a deeper analysis over how he received such a relaxed military conviction drills dupes  informantsa day after the suspicious san bernardino shooting in 2015 san antonio s nonprofit alamo community group began practicing active shooter scenarios with employees san antonio is only 35 miles from where the sutherland springs mass shooting took place and a city that has been rigorously training for mass casualty scenarios for the last five years holding active shooter drills with approximately one hundred officers a week over at least the last couple of years here s a passage from an abc affiliate in san antonio on the matter though it the training is simulated for active shooting scenarios the training could easily be applied to many other mass casualty situations as well in past two years about 4000 people have been involved in san antonio s new rescue task force training program as 21 wire has documented over the years many socalled shootingterrorattacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place a place where a lone wolf graduates into the ranks of a known wolf although the military wasn t officially keeping kelley under watch his case profile does exhibit potential signs of a possible informant status due to the litany of charges he managed to avoid through a cushy plea deal with the military historically government operators have often made use of lowlife criminals and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various roles in entrapment stings or sometimes as bona fide solo actors in an actual attacks links between security agencies military facilities and alleged attackers with a criminal history should arouse suspicion if they become connected to any future crimesin january of 2015 a strategic security service thinktank known as the soufan group reported that a larger national security threat resides with those who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies the soufan group a new york think tank said a better term for lone wolves would be known wolves  given how many are already known to western intelligence agencies before they strike these individuals acting alone or in small groups have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism it said in a report this week domestically in america it has been well documented that the fbi created a counterintelligence program known as cointelpro similar in scope to the cia s operation chaos not only as a way to influence but also a way to disrupt and coerce both left and rightwing political factions from the inside out the fbi program infiltrated countless groups and movements across the political spectrumover the past several years the fbi has been routinely caught foiling their very own terror plots following one of america s most deadly mass shootings at the orlando pulse nightclub reports

NEW YORK KNOWN WOLF: Halloween Truck Attacker Known to DHS Prior to ‘Act of Terror’,shawn helton 21st century wireyears before allegedly carrying out a truck rampage on halloween the man named in new york s most recent act of terror was already wellknown to the united states department of homeland security this latest supposedly homegrown isisinspired attack produces yet another known wolf with ties to suspected terrorists as well as authorities according to officials 29 yearold sayfullo saipov the man charged in a deadly manhattan vehicular assault on october 31st was previously questioned over suspected ties to terrorism in 2015 by the us department of homeland security saipov reportedly became a permanent legal resident upon arriving in the us on a diversity lottery visa in 2010 since that time the suspected terrorist moved from ohio florida and most recently to new jersey where he was interviewed by dhs in 2015as media attention on this case is focused on immigration laws terror propaganda and security protocols america s latest terror tragedy reveals much more below the surface known wolf there s a distinct pattern with acts of terror committed on western soil photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonanother american known wolf suspected terrorist sayfullo habibullaevic saipov who bounced across america committed only minor traffic violations before his alleged involvement in the new york truck attackover the past 24 hours the suspected truck attacker saipov was said to have driven a home depot rental truck from new jersey to the manhattan area where it is believed he deliberately targeted pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path alongside the hudson river according to police reports shortly after the vehicular attack authorities state that siapov brandished a pellet gun and paintball gun prior to being shot by nypd and taken into custody all told at least eight people were said to have been killed while nearly a dozen others were injured in the highprofile terror incidentreports state that saipov became radicalized in america allegedly taking ques from isis terror propaganda however saipov originally from tashkent the capital city of uzbekistan was supposedly from a modest and secular family that did not go to mosques making this yet another suspicious terrorrelated case that paints a murky portrait on the way towards extremism suspect the alleged new york truck attacker was apparently a registered driver for popular car services uber and lyft image source twitterrather intriguingly in a published report at abc news we re told saipov had been the subject of a deeper counterterror investigation back in 2015 sayfullo saipov who has been charged with killing eight people in a vehicle attack on the west side of manhattan on tuesday was interviewed in 2015 by federal agents about possible ties to suspected terrorists but a case was never opened against him law enforcement officials tell abc news continuing the article outlined the following saipov was listed as a point of contact for two men who were listed in a department of homeland security counterterrorism database and later overstayed their tourist visas a federal official told abc news one was flagged after arriving from a socalled threat country while the other vanished and was being actively sought by federal agents as a suspected terrorist incredibly in less than 24 hours after the deadly vehicular assault in new york fbi authorities have located the suspected terrorist who supposedly vanished from the gaze of authorities said to be linked to saipovtoday fbi investigators released an alert regarding 32 yearold mukhammadzoir kadirov a person of interest who authorities also believe is linked to the recent attackcnn reported the following background information regarding siapovin a recently published report from the ny times elements of a recent fbi probe into a suspected terror cell charged in brooklyn over the past two years was revealed over the last two years a terrorism investigation by the fbi the department of homeland security the new york police department and federal prosecutors in brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from uzbekistan and one from kazakhstan of providing material support to isis several of the men have pleaded guilty it is unclear whether mr saipov was connected with that investigation question will the fbi eventually reveal that saipov and kadirov were on their radar prior to the new york truck attack only time will tell this latest act of terror in america may well prove to be similar in scope to many other known wolf cases in recent history as readers might recall the alleged new york bombing suspect 28 yearold ahmad khan rahami had been known to the fbi for years prior to supposedly carrying out plots in new york and new jersey in the fall of 2016according to the washington post the fbi had already known rahami since 2014 which only added to the strongly suspicious event the fbi s probe into ahmad khan rahami the 28yearold named as the only suspect in the bombings was launched based on comments his father had made an official said his father later recanted his comments agents conducted interviews checked with other agencies and looked at internal databases none of which revealed ties to terrorism the bureau said in a statement dark days the crime scene of the recent new york truck attack image source twitterhand in hand terror  security question is it possible the fbi or any intelligence agency played some part in the latest new york city attack plot whether inadvertently or otherwisein the search for answers regarding the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies that have come into question there s none perhaps more dubious than the fbi s newburgh sting operation that resulted in the entrapment four men who participated in a fabricated event created by the bureauhere s a 2011 passage from the guardian describing how a fbi informant named shahed hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot the newburgh four now languish in jail hussain does not for hussain was a fake in fact hussain worked for the fbi as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicalsyet far from being active militants the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with newburgh s grim epidemic of crack drug crime and poverty one had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine he also believed florida was a foreign countryhussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot including 250000 to one man and free holidays and expensive carsas defence lawyers poured through the evidence the newburgh four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial fbi policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets there has been no case as egregious as this it is unique in the incentive the government provided a quarter million dollars said professor karen greenberg a terrorism expert at fordham university the reputation of the fbi has suffered greatly in the recent past as well as over the past couple of decades following the 1993 wtc bombing the fbi was revealed to have been handling emad a salem a former egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the bomb plotquestion will authorities reveal that siapov may have also had ties to informants or other known wolveshere at 21wire we ve kept a running report on known wolf

Robert Parry: Sorting Out the Russia Mess,consortium news exclusive the us mainstream media finally has its smoking gun on russiagate incriminating information from a junior trump campaign adviser but a closer look reveals serious problems with the evidence writes robert parryby robert parryrussiagate special prosecutor robert mueller has turned up the heat on president trump with the indictment of trump s former campaign manager for unrelated financial crimes and the disclosure of a guilty plea from a lowlevel foreign policy adviser for lying to the fbiwhile longtime republican fixer paul manafort who helped guide trump s campaign to the gop nomination in summer 2016 was the big name in the news on monday the mainstream media focused more on court documents related to george papadopoulos a 30yearold campaign aide who claims to have heard about russia possessing hillary clinton s emails before they became public on the internet mostly via wikileakswhile that would seem to bolster the russiagate narrative that russian intelligence hacked democratic emails and president vladimir putin ordered the emails be made public to undermine clinton s campaign the evidentiary thread that runs through papadopoulos s account remains tenuousthat s in part because his credibility has already been undermined by his guilty plea for lying to the fbi and by the fact that he now has a motive to provide something the prosecutors might want in exchange for leniency plus there is the hearsay and contested quality of papadopoulos s supposed information some of which already has turned out to be falseaccording to the court documents papadopoulos got to know a professor of international relations who claimed to have substantial connections with russian government officials with the professor identified in press reports as joseph mifsud a littleknown academic associated with the university of stirling in scotlandthe first contact supposedly occurred in midmarch 2016 in italy with a second meeting in london on march 24 when the professor purportedly introduced papadopoulos to a russian woman whom the young campaign aide believed to be putin s niece an assertion that mueller s investigators determined wasn t truetrump who then was under pressure for not having a foreign policy team included papadopoulos as part of a list drawn up to fill that gap and papadopoulos participated in a campaign meeting on march 31 in washington at which he suggested a meeting between trump and putin a prospect that other senior aides reportedly slapped downthe email breakfastbut papadopoulos continued his outreach to russia according to the court documents which depict the most explosive meeting as an april 26 breakfast in london with the professor mifsud supposedly saying he had been in moscow and learned that the russians had obtained dirt on thencandidate clinton and possessed thousands of emails mainstream press accounts concluded that mifsud must have been referring to the laterreleased emailshowever mifsud told the washington post in an email last august that he had absolutely no contact with the russian government and described his ties to russia as strictly in academic fieldsin an interview with the uk daily telegraph after monday s disclosures mifsud acknowledged meeting with papadopoulos but disputed the contents of the conversations as cited in the court papers specifically he denied knowing anything about emails containing dirt on clinton and called the claim that he introduced papadopoulos to a female russian national as a laughingstock according to the telegraph interview mifsud said he tried to put papadopoulos in touch with experts on the european union and introduced him to the director of a russian think tank the russian international affairs councilit was the latter contact that the court papers presumably referred to in saying that on may 4 the russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to papadopoulos and mifsud reporting that ministry officials were open for cooperation a message that papadopoulos forwarded to a senior campaign official asking whether the contacts were something we want to move forward with however even an article in the new york times which has aggressively pushed the russiagate scandal from the beginning noted the evidentiary holes that followed from that pointthe times scott shane wrote a crucial detail is still missing whether and when mr papadopoulos told senior trump campaign officials about russia s possession of hacked emails and it appears that the young aide s quest for a deeper connection with russian officials while he aggressively pursued it led nowhere shane added the court documents describe in detail how mr papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with russian officials the documents do not say explicitly whether and to whom he passed on his most explosive discovery that the russians had what they considered compromising emails on mr trump s opponent jd gordon a former pentagon official who worked for the trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the march 31 foreign policy meeting said he had known nothing about mr papadopoulos discovery that russia had obtained democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with russians reasons to doubtif prosecutor mueller had direct evidence that papadopoulos had informed the trump campaign about the clinton emails you would assume that the proof would have been included in monday s disclosures further since papadopoulos was flooding the campaign with news about his russian outreach you might have expected that he would say something about how helpful the russians had been in publicizing the democratic emailsthe absence of supporting evidence that papadopoulos conveyed his hot news on the emails to campaign officials and mifsud s insistence that he knew nothing about the emails would normally raise serious questions about papadopoulos s credibility on this most crucial pointat least for now those gaps represent major holes in the storyline but official washington has been so desperate for proof about the alleged russian election meddling for so long that professional skepticism has been unwelcome in most media outletsthere is also another side of the story that rarely gets mentioned in the us mainstream media that wikileaks founder julian assange has repeatedly denied that he received the two batches of purloined democratic emails one about the democratic national committee and one about clinton s campaign chairman john podesta from the russians while it is surely possible that the russians might have used cutouts to pass on the emails assange and associates have suggested that at least the dnc emails came from a disgruntled insideralso former us intelligence experts have questioned whether at least one batch of disclosed emails could have come from an overseas hack because the rapid download speed is more typical of copying files locally onto a memory stick or thumb drivewhat i was told by an intelligence source several months ago was that russian intelligence did engage in hacking efforts to uncover sensitive information much as us and other nations intelligence services do and that democratic targets were included in the russian effortbut the source said the more perplexing question was whether the kremlin then ordered release of the data something that russian intelligence is usually loath to do and something that in this case would have risked retaliation from the expected winner of the 2016 election hillary clintonbut such questions and doubts are clearly not welcome in the us mainstream media most of which has embraced mueller s

MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS: Was Sandy Hook Shooter Known to FBI Prior to School Massacre?,21st century wire says the fbi recently released new documents regarding the bizarre and still forensically critiqued sandy hook elementary school shooting tragedy sandy hook many questions still remain in this perplexing case photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonkey point it s important to remember that even though the events at sandy hook were said to have been carried out by a deranged lone gunman named adam lanza initial reports on several cbs and abc affiliates following the sandy hook mass shooting stated there was a second shooter who was apprehended at the scenewe should also be reminded that mainstream media reportage of the sandy hook tragedy took audiences down several rabbit holes of their own making eventually implicating an unlikely suspect left photo with asperger s syndrome in an apparently motiveless crimenot since the forensically questionable columbine high school shooting massacre had the corporate media been so fixated on a tragic shooting focusing their efforts on politicizing the apparent crime while investigators offered very little in terms of evidence in their official storyon march 28th of 2013 a few short months after the sandy hook shooting an article entitled newtown killer s obsessions in chilling detail was published by the ny times in that article the public learned that the lanza s were unknown to authorities and that there were never any disturbances at the family residence that would have prepped law enforcement prior to the school shooting two lawenforcement officials who were initially involved in the investigation said in recent interviews that the newtown police had never been called to the lanza home for any disturbances and that before the shootings the family was basically unknown to the authoritiesthey said they believed that mr lanza had spent most of his time in the basement of the home primarily playing a warfare video game call of duty this aspect of the story had remained virtually unquestioned until the recent release of fbi information this weekearlier this week an nbc affiliate in connecticut published an article disclosing the newly released fbi documents regarding the sandy hook case here s a short passage of that article the documents include reports by fbi agents who interviewed people about lanza large portions of many of the documents were redacted including the names of the people who spoke to the agentsthe documents also offer a window into the early days of the investigation as agents chased false leads and gathered evidence of lanza s isolationa year after the massacre state police released a final investigative document that concluded lanza was obsessed with firearms death and mass shootings but that the motive may never be known while the article continued by placing a heavy emphasis on the media crafted stagelike persona of the alleged shooter adam lanza we re told for the first time of his alleged sexual perversions as the video gamegun obsessed millennial apparently also spent time analyzing mass shooting crimesthis murky portrait of the sandy hook shooter finally emerges nearly five years after the media sensationalized school shooting but perhaps the most shocking claim has come from an unnamed newtown resident alleging that lanza may have already been wellknown to the fbi or possibly the cia prior to the sandy hook school massacre occurring a newtown resident told the fbi that nancy lanza said adam had once hacked into a government computer system and federal authorities either fbi or cia agents showed up at their doornancy lanza told the person that she had to convince the agents that her son was just very intelligent and was challenging himself to see if he could hack into a government system she said agents told her that if adam was that smart he could get a job with their agency someday question why is the public just now learning that lanza may have already been known to authorities via his government computer hack and why wouldn t various intelligence agencies continue to monitor his behavior after committing an illegal act that may have been a national security concernthe troubling sandy hook saga continues to have more questions than answers read more daily shooter news at 21st century wire daily shooter filessupport 21wire subscribe  become a member  21wiretv,Middle-east,25-Oct-17,0

New Survey Shows No.1 Fear of US Citizens is Government NOT Terrorism,americans have lost the plot when it comes to evaluating the true nature of the terrorist threat image source wikicommonsby matt agoristan extensive survey of hundreds of adults across the united states has just revealed that the thing most americans fear more than anything else is their own government in fact according to the survey no other fear even comes close to the percentage of americans who worry about their corrupt government officialsthe survey was conducted by chapman university and it serves to back up the point that while americans claim to live in the land of the free deep down they realize they are living in a corrupt oligarchy the chapman university survey of american fears wave 4 2017 provides an indepth examination into the fears of average americans in may of 2017 a random sample of 1207 adults from across the united states were asked their level of fear about eighty different fears across a huge variety of topics ranging from crime the government the environment disasters personal anxieties technology and many others as statista s niall mccarthy notes like last year corruption of government officials came top in 2017 with 745 percent of us adults saying it makes them afraid or very afraid despite the constant fear mongering from the mainstream media and government on bogeymen terrorists plotting to steal our freedom the public according to this survey is not buying itin fact the threat of terrorism isn t even in the top 20 fears terrorism comes in at twentytwo below credit card fraud and identity theftwhile this survey is certainly promising in the idea that people are waking up to government corruption it is also a telling sign of america s ability to hold two entirely contradictory ideas as selfevidentthis ability or perhaps better defined as disability to hold two opposing ideas such as the spreading of freedom through war as being logically sound is called cognitive dissonance when one is in a state of dissonance they may sometimes feel disequilibrium  frustration hunger dread guilt anger embarrassment anxiety etcin order for cognitive dissonance to work society must remain just ignorant enough to support and to believe the lies fed to them from the establishment as reality even though this reality is a complete contradictiononce we step back and observe society with this in mind the reason for this contradictory mental state becomes quite obvious it is much easier to remain delusional and in a state of suspended disbelief than it is to deal with the opposing ideas held inside one s head how can one chant usa is number 1 while at the same time fearing the rulers of that usa  if this survey shows us anything it is that americans would do well to entertain the uncomfortable idea that this country they hold so high up on a pedestal has actually long been on a path to become the dystopian nightmare written about in books like 1984americans would do well to remember the words by john basil barnhill in 1914 when he said where the people fear the government you have tyranny where the government fears the people you have liberty this article first appeared the free thought projectread more war on terror news at 21st century wire war on terror filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,Middle-east,23-Oct-17,0
"WHITE WASHED? Trump Claims Classified JFK Files Will Be Released, Reigniting Conspiracy Suspicions",shawn helton 21st century wire jfk files conspiracy still shrouds the jfk assassination photo illustration shawn heltonthe assassination of us president john f kennedy is one of the most infamous crimes of the 20th century like the enigmatic attacks of 911 it was an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy intrigue and mystery despite the lone gunman theory implicating lee harvey oswaldnew reports indicate that classified documents pertaining to the assassination of the 35th us president will be allowed to be released by us president donald trumpthe ny times reports the release of the information being held in secret at the national archives including several thousand neverbeforeseen documents was mandated to occur by oct 26 under a 1992 law that sought to quell conspiracy theories about the assassinationmr trump has the power to block the release of the documents and intelligence agencies have pressured him to do so for at least some of them the agencies are concerned that information contained in some of the documents could damage national security interestsin a statement to reporters the white house left open the possibility that mr trump might halt the release of some documents while word of a possible release of neverbeforeseen jfk files has spread like wildfire throughout mainstream media and alternative media alike one should remain skeptical and cautious as the likelihood of the military industrial complex the cia and other clandestine agencies releasing any conclusive interagency conspiracy related details about the jfk assassination is next to zerothe globalist deep state machine that has ruled the us and the world since wwii would have too much to lose if anything larger came out of america s most infamous conspiracy it would be like opening pandora s box image source circololettoriithere s one theory in the mystery surrounding jfk s assassination that includes some uncanny historical and hollywood associations that we are not likely to hear about in 1980 after a sixhour suicidal standoff with police a contract killer linked to organized crime named charles harrelson admitted to killing us district judge john h wood and in the process while apparently high on cocaine also claimed to have been involved in the assassination of president john f kennedythe father of hollywood star woody harrelson was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named sam degelia jr in 1968 and in 1981 charles received two life sentences for the murder of john woodthroughout 1981 more questions materialized regarding the assassination of judge wood in a upi article defense lawyers maintained charles harrelson was framed by police and the informant charles an exfelon said a friend hampton robinson iii who failed to show up to testify had driven the car he suggested someone possibly federal agents had planted the guns so he could be arrested he denied telling department of public safety agent pagel he carried a gun three tramps charles harrelson id d by forensic experts on the left is believed to be one of three arrested in dealey plaza after jfk s assassination in 1963 image source jfkmurdersolvedwhen considering the harrelsonkennedy connection the 1989 book crossfire comes to mindcrossfire written by the recently deceased wellknown researcher jim marrs was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful oliver stone film jfk below is a passage from crossfire as it relates to the apparent harrelsonkennedy link aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire harrelson the father of actor woody harrelson had a long history of involvement with dallas underworld characters linked directly to jack ruby continuing the crossfire also stated the late fort worth graphics expert jack white who testified before the house select committee on assassinations already had noticed the resemblance of harrelson to the youngest tramp in a 1981 interview with chuck cook harrelson claimed to have the biggest story the reporter would ever have when questioned about kennedy s death additionally jo ann harrelson noted the similarities between the tramp photos and her husband all this coupled with the fact diane lou oswald the mother of woody harrelson who had also been married to charles harrelson in midland texas made for a strange background concerning the jfk sagain a kdfwtv interview in 1982 below charles harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing kennedy but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the us government s involvement in the death of kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in americathe interview is a startling revelation adding to the enigmatic jfk mystery and in the process provides another strange backdrop to a captivating case  21st century wire says today president donald trump announced he plans to release the tens of thousands of classified documents on the assassination of president john f kennedy held at the national archives and records administration the president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise a white house official told reuters subject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened trump tweeted on saturdaysubject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 21 2017days before trump s announcement the washington post claim that their national security council source told deep state media oracle that federal government agencies have warned the president not to release some of the documents for fear they could somehow comprise national security  although this rationale is hard to justify as the event took place nearly 55 years ago unless of course some legacy parties still in power today were implicated in the remaining documentsit s difficult to know if trump is referring to all of the remaining cia and fbi documents or just some of them or whether or not these documents will be redacted presumably to protect any important names involved in the jfk murder or possible coverup however trump appears to have left open the possibility that if government agencies feel the documents should not to released then he would heed their advice trump added that his decision was subject to the receipt of further information according to phil shenon a professional researcher and author on the warren commission it s great news that the president is focused on this and that he s trying to demonstrate transparency but the question remains whether he will open the library in full every word in every document as the law requires shenon said and my understanding is that he won t without infuriating people at the cia and elsewhere who are determined to keep at least some of the information secret especially in documents created in the 1990s the scheduled date of the release is meant to be on october 26 2017stay tuned for more updatesread more jfk news at 21st century wire jfk

‘Man Bites Dog’: New York Times Does Some Actual Journalism,what this story shows is that while there are some conscientious journalists at the new york times who have made a concerted effort to discover the truth about president trump s somewhat outlandish claim that the cuban government have deployed sonic attacks against us diplomats in havana the paper s editors also ran with the predictable mainstream conspiracy theory that putin might be behind this malicious hightech assault on us foreign service officialsis there an internal struggle underway in mainstream media institutions between those who want to retain their integrity and gatekeepers determine to use these outlets to peddle establishment propagandaconsortium news exclusive when the trump administration blamed cuba for a sonic attack on us diplomats a new york times reporter did something unusual for his newspaper he tried objectively to assess the evidence as robert parry reports by robert parryi often criticize the new york times washington post and other major mainstream media outlets for a very simple reason they deserve it especially for their propagandistic unprofessional and reckless coverage of foreign crisesbut there are occasional moments when some reporter at an msm outlet behaves responsibly and those instances should be noted at least under the classic definition of news something that is unexpected or as the old saying goes dog bites man is not news man bites dog is news one such moment occurred earlier this month when a times science editor assigned science reporter carl zimmer to look into the mysterious illnesses affecting us diplomats in the recently reopened us embassy in cubaabout two dozen us diplomats supposedly were suffering hearing loss and cognitive difficulties due to what has been labeled a sonic attack the trump administration blamed the cuban government even though the cubans claimed to be mystified and would seem to have little motive for disrupting a longsought d tente with washington along with the expected boon to their tourist industry president trump retaliated by expelling 15 cuban diplomatszimmer recounted the background to his story in a reporter s notebook piece on oct 6 on tuesday michael mason my editor on the science desk shot me an email would i consider writing an article about this sonic attack business  i knew exactly what he was talking about i had been vaguely puzzled about this business for months checking out the storyzimmer then did what professional journalists are supposed to do he started contacting impartial experts to get their assessments of what was possible what was likely and what didn t make sense i decided to try to find something out not as a political reporter but as a science writer zimmer wrote in the sidebar that accompanied his news article i usually base my ideas on scientific research that has matured far enough that it is beginning to get published in peerreviewed journals i knew that an article on sonic weapons would be very different from the ones i usually write i learned there was not even an official medical report i decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story is the idea of a sonic attack plausible based on what scientists know about sound and the human body so i hit the phone i didn t want to talk with just anyone i looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question i started with timothy leighton whose job title at southampton university is literally professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics better yet dr leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that i m aware of when i interviewed dr leighton and others i made clear i didn t expect them to solve this mystery i just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science the consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon it would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously yet despite this skeptical scientific consensus among experts zimmer noted the notion of a sonic attack has ricocheted like mad around the press making it possible for readers to assume that the sonic attack explanation has been generally accepted by experts but it most certainly has not i ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation suspecting putinwell zimmer could have read the times editorial in the same day s oct 6 newspaper for a partial answer while critical of the trump administration for rushing to judgment in blaming the cuban government and expelling 15 diplomats the editorial concluded the sonic attacks on americans are too serious to be used for cynical political ends so much for the editorial writers reading their own newspaper but clearly they were driven by a higher agenda a new york times editorial about some unpleasant topic anywhere in the world these days wouldn t be complete without taking the opportunity to blame russia or in this case at least suggest russia as a possible villain in the mysterythe times wrote other parties most notably russia must also figure as suspects president vladimir putin would probably welcome a setback to americancuban relations yes every possible conspiracy theory must somehow circle back to vladimir putin a reallife dr evil when he is not plotting how to flood facebook with images of puppies or manipulate americans in their pursuit of pokemon go characters he is building secret sonic weapons to disorient us diplomats in havana and provoke president trump to act rashly when we all know how cool and collected trump

analysis of the survivor s taledespite sensationalized reportage at this time there s no concrete evidence to prove a social mediabased conspiracy concerning the death of suchomel according to the original story first published by the daily press we re told suchomel died in her sleep as she was said to have suffered from epilepsy and had been prone to seizures additionally suchomel who was reportedly taking medication for a pituitary tumor was discovered dead by her grandmother julie norton at 830am on october 9th at her apple valley california home at this moment an autopsy of suchomel s death is still pendingquestion is it possible that open source investigators were being led into a virtual culdesac and thus missing the real storymedia tripwireundoubtedly the uncanny timing of suchomel s death has come on the heels of a brewing controversy over the las vegas mass shooting this has led to increased speculation turbocharging even more spurious internetbased conspiracies and allegations these now viral stories have simultaneously been published as anonymous survivor claims from those close to suchomel have presented facebook messages associated with her account suchomel s claims also allude to multiple shooters involved in the las vegas shooting as she allegedly planned to organize a group of survivors and that the media can suck it they have no idea what went down while suchomel s story is compelling you have to wonder is there more than we ve been toldat face value suchomel s public account of the las vegas shooting is persuasive and does appear to question the official narrative however one should look at information from multiple angles in order to formulate a more full spectrum understanding of complex multilayered criminalityupdate below are two screen shots associated with a linkedin profile under the name of kymberley suchomel we at 21wire cannot verify if this profile is connected in anyway to the las vegas shooting survivor or not but several similarities in the appearance of the individual home location and the inclusion of an aerospace industry government contractor aerozone along with others raises some serious questions the inclusion of the above linkedin profile is not necessarily an endorsement of a larger conspiracy concerning the suchomel saga however the linkedin revelations above have surfaced at or around the same time as other government contractor links have been uncovered regarding the las vegas shooting survivor s charitable foundation see belowquestionis the linkedin profile above a ruse someone else or another mysterious part of the suchomel storysee also the las vegas mass shooting more to the story than we ve been toldalthough the police dispatch communication along with eyewitness testimony reveals some startling information contradicting the official story surrounding the las vegas mass shooting one must be cautious when looking at all of the available evidence of a suspicious crime however difficult that may beas larger outlets in alternative media such as infowars have sensationalized this highly emotive aspect of the las vegas tragedy a series of formulaic polarizing political points have become an echo chamber in its aftermath this type of conjecture rapidly descends into wild speculation only serving to magnify emotionally driven elements of a particular story something that could be used to deliberately steer public perception away from any potential forensic cluesit s important to remember that during same time site intelligence injected an isis meme into the las vegas tragedy without revealing any solid evidence infowars quickly followed suit this then prompted an apparent official statement that echoed those dubious claims from the terror group isis although these claims still linger they ve failed to produce any real connection to isisas we ve noted numerous times here at 21wire the intelligence monitoring group called site has ties to both the cia and israeli intelligence the group has also had ethical concerns raised over the nature of their intel gathering in the last decade and according to the group s founder rita katz they ve managed to release terror related material linked to isis prior to the group itself geo group a privateforprofit corrections and detention firm formerly known as wackenhut corrections corporation under the umbrella of the wackenhut corporation image source corporatewatchstrange bedfellows follow the moneywhat you re about to see below is a collection of material revealing what appears to be a rather incredible financial component connected to the high desert phoenix foundation a charitable organization cofounded by the recently deceased las vegas mass shooting survivor kymberley suchomel the high desert phoenix foundation claims to have raised funds for grieving families affected by trauma since 2008 this amazing coincidence rather incredibly has not been mentioned once in any of the conspiratorial claims surrounding the suchomel story at alternative media outlets put another way a survivor of a traumatic event has been a long time cofounder of a foundation that contends to have helped those who have endured a traumatic tragedy themselves it s a difficult question to ask but what are the chances of this uncanny coincidencefurthermore new evidence uncovers details concerning the high desert phoenix foundation s highprofile sponsors one that includes the the geo group inc geo this long time financial donor is also linked to wellknown government contractor security firms is this also a coincidencein recent years controversy has enveloped the multibilliondollar corporation known as geo group critics of geo group contend that politically motivated contributions have led to an expansion of its forprofit prisons system through federal state and government contractual agreements at the expense of public safety even more concerning is that critics argue that geo group has fostered a dangerous work environment via it s under staffed operations inadequate training and apparent mistreatment of detainees and other inmates this has led to a potentially volatile situation for communities nearby geo group s facilities question does this sound like a suitable donor for a charitable foundation known for helping grieving familiesin 1984 wackenhut corrections corporation wcc had been formed as a part of the wackenhut corporation in 2003 wcc management bought up all stock held by its subsidiary g4s altering its name to the geo group incin 2004 other divisions of the wackenhut corporation were purchased by group 4 falck a security focused subsidiary known as g4s wackenhut was later renamed again as g4s secure solutionshere s a screen shot of the high desert phoenix foundation s mission statement notice the modest look of the website an organization with the financial backing of the multibillion dollar geo group one of the nation s largest forprofit prison operators the reason why the geo group link is so significant is that prior to modern america s largest mass shooting in las vegas an apparent survivor of the incident was operating a foundation that was accepting financial support from a largescale company formerly known as the wackenhut corporation a subsidiary of g4s secure solutions one of the world s largest security firms and a department of homeland security connected conglomerate tied to the suspicious orlando shooting in the summer of 2016 an event that was previously the country s largest mass shooting if you remember 29year old omar mateen an afghaniamerican was located in port st lucie florida about 120 miles outside of orlando in 2013 mateen was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months interviewed two to three times by the fbi 201314 and had worked for g4s secure solutions headquartered in jupiter florida a company which was formerly part of a cialinked government contractor and security firm known as the wackenhut corporationg4s as it turns out was the very first designated and certified department of homeland security dhs contractor and recently secured a 234 million dollar contract with the federal cabinet department in addition to apparently providing security solutions for 90 percent of us nuclear facilities g4s according to border patrol sources has also been tasked with the transportation and release of illegal immigrants inside the interior of the united states at least one of mateen s roles with g4s was to transport and provide security for prisoner youths in

ANTIFA: Self-Appointed Radical Revolutionaries or Neoliberal Thought Police?, antifa photo twitterdiana johnstone 21st century wire fascists are divided into two categories the fascists and the antifascists  ennio flaianoin recent weeks a totally disoriented left has been widely exhorted to unify around a masked vanguard calling itself antifa for antifascist hooded and dressed in black antifa is essentially a variation of the black bloc familiar for introducing violence into peaceful demonstrations in many countries imported from europe the label antifa sounds more political it also serves the purpose of stigmatizing those it attacks as fascists despite its imported european name antifa is basically just another example of america s steady descent into violencehistorical pretensionsantifa first came to prominence from its role in reversing berkeley s proud free speech tradition by preventing right wing personalities from speaking there but its moment of glory was its clash with rightwingers in charlottesville on august 12 largely because trump commented that there were good people on both sides  with exuberant schadenfreude commentators grabbed the opportunity to condemn the despised president for his moral equivalence  thereby bestowing a moral blessing on antifacharlottesville served as a successful book launching for antifa the antifascist handbook whose author young academic mark bray is an antifa in both theory and practice the book is really taking off very fast  rejoiced the publisher melville house it instantly won acclaim from leading mainstream media such as the new york timesthe guardian and nbc not hitherto known for rushing to review leftwing books least of all those by revolutionary anarchiststhe washington post welcomed bray as spokesman for insurgent activist movements and observed that the book s most enlightening contribution is on the history of antifascist efforts over the past century but its most relevant for today is its justification for stifling speech and clobbering white supremacists bray s enlightening contribution is to a tell a flattering version of the antifa story to a generation whose dualistic holocaustcentered view of history has largely deprived them of both the factual and the analytical tools to judge multidimensional events such as the growth of fascism bray presents today s antifa as though it were the glorious legitimate heir to every noble cause since abolitionism but there were no antifascists before fascism and the label antifa by no means applies to all the many adversaries of fascismthe implicit claim to carry on the tradition of the international brigades who fought in spain against franco is nothing other than a form of innocence by association since we must revere the heroes of the spanish civil war some of that esteem is supposed to rub off on their selfdesignated heirs unfortunately there are no veterans of the abraham lincoln brigade still alive to point to the difference between a vast organized defense against invading fascist armies and skirmishes on the berkeley campus as for the anarchists of catalonia the patent on anarchism ran out a long time ago and anyone is free to market his own genericthe original antifascist movement was an effort by the communist international to cease hostilities with europe s socialist parties in order to build a common front against the triumphant movements led by mussolini and hitlersince fascism thrived and antifa was never a serious adversary its apologists thrive on the nipped in the bud claim if only antifascists had beat up the fascist movements early enough the latter would have been nipped in the bud since reason and debate failed to stop the rise of fascism they argue we must use street violence which by the way failed even more decisivelythis is totally ahistorical fascism exalted violence and violence was its preferred testing ground both communists and fascists were fighting in the streets and the atmosphere of violence helped fascism thrive as a bulwark against bolshevism gaining the crucial support of leading capitalists and militarists in their countries which brought them to powersince historic fascism no longer exists bray s antifa have broadened their notion of fascism to include anything that violates the current identity politics canon from patriarchy a prefascist attitude to put it mildly to transphobia decidedly a postfascist problemthe masked militants of antifa seem to be more inspired by batman than by marx or even by bakuninstorm troopers of the neoliberal war partysince mark bray offers european credentials for current us antifa it is appropriate to observe what antifa amounts to in europe todayin europe the tendency takes two forms black bloc activists regularly invade various leftist demonstrations in order to smash windows and fight the police these testosterone exhibits are of minor political significance other than provoking public calls to strengthen police forces they are widely suspected of being influenced by police infiltrationas an example last september 23 several dozen blackclad masked ruffians tearing down posters and throwing stones attempted to storm the platform where the flamboyant jeanluc m lenchon was to address the mass meeting of la france insoumise today the leading leftist party in france their unspoken message seemed to be that nobody is revolutionary enough for them occasionally they do actually spot a random skinhead to beat up this establishes their credentials as antifascist they use these credentials to arrogate to themselves the right to slander others in a sort of informal selfappointed inquisitionas prime example in late 2010 a young woman named ornella guyet appeared in paris seeking work as a journalist in various leftist periodicals and blogs she tried to infiltrate everywhere  according to the former director of le monde diplomatique maurice lemoine who always intuitively distrusted her when he hired her as an internviktor dedaj who manages one of the main leftist sites in france le grand soir was among those who tried to help her only to experience an unpleasant surprise a few months later ornella had become a selfappointed inquisitor dedicated to denouncing conspirationism confusionism antisemitism and redbrown on internet this took the form of personal attacks on individuals whom she judged to be guilty of those sins what is significant is that all her targets were opposed to us and nato aggressive wars in the middle eastindeed the timing of her crusade coincided with the regime change wars that destroyed libya and tore apart syria the attacks singled out leading critics of those warsviktor dedaj was on her hit list so was michel collon close to the belgian workers party author activist and manager of the bilingual site investig action so was fran ois ruffin filmmaker editor of the leftist journal fakir elected recently to the national assembly on the list of m lenchon s party la france insoumise and so on the list is longthe targeted personalities are diverse but all have one thing in common opposition to aggressive wars what s more so far as i can tell just about everyone opposed to those wars is on her listthe main technique is guilt by association high on the list of mortal sins is criticism of the european union which is associated with nationalism which is associated with fascism which is associated with antisemitism  hinting at a penchant for genocide this coincides perfectly with the official policy of the eu and eu governments but antifa uses much harsher languagein midjune 2011 the antieu party union populaire r publicaine led by fran ois asselineau was the object of slanderous insinuations on antifa internet sites signed by marieanne boutoleau a pseudonym for ornella guyet fearing violence owners cancelled scheduled upr meeting places in lyon upr did a little investigation discovering that ornella guyet was on the speakers list at a march 2009 seminar on international media organized in paris by the center for the study of international communications and the school of media and public affairs at george washington university a surprising association for such a zealous crusader against redbrown in case anyone has doubts redbrown is a term used to smear anyone with generally leftist views that is red with the fascist color brown  this smear can be based on having the same opinion as someone on the right speaking on the same platform with someone on the right being published alongside someone on the right being seen at an antiwar demonstration also attended by someone on the right and so on this is particularly useful for the war party since these days many conservatives are more opposed to war than leftists who have bought into the humanitarian war mantrathe government doesn t need to repress antiwar gatherings antifa does the jobthe francoafrican comedien dieudonn m bala m bala stigmatized for antisemitism since 2002 for his tv sketch lampooning an israeli settler as part of george w bush s axis of good  is not only a target but serves as a guilty association for anyone who defends his right to free speech such as belgian professor jean bricmont virtually blacklisted in france for trying to get in a word in favor of free speech during a tv talk show dieudonn has been banned from the media sued and fined countless times even sentenced to jail in belgium but continues to enjoy a full house of enthusiastic supporters at his oneman shows where the main political message is opposition to warstill accusations of being soft on dieudonn can have serious effects on individuals in more precarious positions since the mere hint of antisemitism can be a career killer in france invitations are cancelled publications refused messages go unansweredin april 2016 ornella guyet dropped out of sight amid strong suspicions about her own peculiar associationsthe moral of this story is simple selfappointed radical revolutionaries can be the most useful thought police for the neoliberal war partyi am not suggesting that all or most antifa are agents of the establishment but they can be manipulated infiltrated or impersonated precisely because they are selfanointed and usually more or less disguisedsilencing necessary debateone who is certainly sincere is mark bray author of the intifa handbook it is clear where mark bray is coming from when he writes p367 hitler s final solution murdered six million jews in gas chambers with firing squads through hunger an lack of medical treatment in squalid camps and ghettoes with beatings by working them to death and through suicidal despair approximately two out of every three jews on the continent were killed including some of my relatives this personal history explains why mark bray feels passionately about fascism  this is perfectly understandable in one who is haunted by fear that it can happen again however even the most justifiable emotional concerns do not necessarily contribute to wise counsel violent reactions to fear may seem to be strong and effective when in reality they are morally weak and practically ineffectualwe are in a period of great political confusion labeling every manifestation of political incorrectness as fascism impedes clarification of debate over issues that very much need to be defined and clarifiedthe scarcity of fascists has been compensated by identifying criticism of immigration as fascism this identification in connection with rejection of national borders derives much of its emotional force above all from the ancestral fear in the jewish community of being excluded from the nations in which they find themselvesthe issue of immigration has different aspects in different places it is not the same in european countries as in the united states there is a basic distinction between immigrants and immigration immigrants are people who deserve consideration immigration is a policy that needs to be evaluated it should be possible to discuss the policy without being accused of persecuting the people after all trade union leaders have traditionally opposed mass immigration not out of racism but because it can be a deliberate capitalist strategy to bring down wagesin reality immigration is a complex subject with many aspects that can lead to reasonable compromise but to polarize the issue misses the chances for compromise by making mass immigration the litmus test of whether or not one is fascist antifa intimidation impedes reasonable discussion without discussion without readiness to listen to all viewpoints the issue will simply divide the population into two camps for and against and who will win such a confrontationa recent survey shows that mass immigration is increasingly unpopular in all european countries the complexity of the issue is shown by the fact that in the vast majority of european countries most people believe they have a duty to welcome refugees but disapprove of continued mass immigration the official argument that immigration is a good thing is accepted by only 40 compared to 60 of all europeans who believe that immigration is bad for our country  a left whose principal cause is open borders will become increasingly unpopularchildish violencethe idea that the way to shut someone up is to punch him in the jaw is as american as hollywood movies it is also typical of the gang war that prevails in certain parts of los angeles banding together with others like us to fight against gangs of them for control of turf is characteristic of young men in uncertain circumstances the search for a cause can involve endowing such conduct with a political purpose either fascist or antifascist for disoriented youth this is an alternative to joining the us marinesamerican antifa looks very much like a middle class wedding between identity politics and gang warfare mark bray page 175 quotes his dc antifa source as implying that the motive of wouldbe fascists is to side with the most powerful kid in the block and will retreat if scared our gang is tougher than your gangthat is also the logic of us imperialism which habitually declares of its chosen enemies all they understand is force although antifa claim to be radical revolutionaries their mindset is perfectly typical the atmosphere of violence which prevails in militarized americain another vein antifa follows the trend of current identity politics excesses that are squelching free speech in what should be its citadel academia words are considered so dangerous that safe spaces must be established to protect people from them this extreme vulnerability to injury from words is strangely linked to tolerance of real physical violencewild goose chasein the united states the worst thing about antifa is the effort to lead the disoriented american left into a wild goose chase tracking down imaginary fascists instead of getting together openly to work out a coherent positive program the united states has more than its share of weird individuals of gratuitous aggression of crazy ideas and tracking down these marginal characters whether alone or in groups is a huge distraction the truly dangerous people in the united states are safely ensconced in wall street in washington think tanks in the executive suites of the sprawling military industry not to mention the editorial offices of some of the mainstream media currently adopting a benevolent attitude toward antifascists simply because they are useful in focusing on the maverick trump instead of themselvesantifa usa by defining resistance to fascism as resistance to lost causes the confederacy white supremacists and for that matter donald trump is actually distracting from resistance to the ruling neoliberal establishment which is also opposed to the confederacy and white supremacists and has already largely managed to capture trump by its implacable campaign of denigration that ruling establishment which in its insatiable foreign wars and introduction of police state methods has successfully used popular resistance to trump to make him even worse than he already wasthe facile use of the term fascist gets in the way of thoughtful identification and definition of the real enemy of humanity today in the contemporary chaos the greatest and most dangerous upheavals in the world all stem from the same source which is hard to name but which we might give the provisional simplified label of globalized imperialism this amounts to a multifaceted project to reshape the world to satisfy the demands of financial capitalism the military industrial complex united states ideological vanity and the megalomania of leaders of lesser western powers notably israel it could be called simply imperialism  except that it is much vaster and more destructive than the historic imperialism of previous centuries it is also much more disguised and since it bears no clear label such as fascism  it is difficult to denounce in simple termsthe fixation on preventing a form of tyranny that arose over 80 years ago under very different circumstances obstructs recognition of the monstrous tyranny of today fighting the previous war leads to defeatdonald trump is an outsider who will not be let inside the election of donald trump is above all a grave symptom of the decadence of the american political system totally ruled by money lobbies the militaryindustrial complex and corporate media their lies are undermining the very basis of democracy antifa has gone on the offensive against the one weapon still in the hands of the people the right to free speech and assemblydiana johnstone is author of the introduction to her father s

Reflections on a World Gone Mad and Pushing Back against Neocolonialist Thuggery, andre vltchek anti diplomaticothe following is an interview with andre vltchek by alessandro biancchi chief editor of the italian political magazine antidiplomaticoalessandro bianchi selfdetermination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country this is of the most complicated issue for international law how can it be articulated for the case of cataloniaandre vltchek personally i m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states particularly those in the west where they would after gaining independence  remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world like nato or the european unionclearly the breaking of the great country of yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile evil design by the west and particularly of germany and austria the dissolution of czechoslovakia after the socalled velvet revolution was a total idiocybut catalonia or basque country if it became independent would become one of the richest parts of europe i don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world as an internationalist i don t really care if they are separate from spain or not or whether they are even richer than they already are as i care much more about what is happening in places such as afghanistan venezuela or north koreaon the other hand the way spain has now behaved in catalonia after the referendum is a total disgrace they decided to treat the catalan people in the same way as indonesians have been treating papuans for decades if this continues it will all reach the point of no return reconciliation will become impossible you cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers one by one just because they want to have their own state you cannot injure hundreds of innocent people who simply don t want to be governed from madrid that s absurd and thoroughly sick of course spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called latin america so it is in their blood  but i don t think catalans will allow this to be done to themwhat about the constitution of spain look there should be nothing sacred about constitutions in the west they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes when they get outdated they should be moderated or totally rewritten if catalans or basques want their independence if they really want it if it is so important for them then why not they should have it spain is not a people s country  it is an oppressive western bully i would have a totally different position if some part of bolivia or china were to try to secedeab different situation and different reality another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of iraqi kurdistan which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area would it be the new israel in the middle east as someone has affirmedav well that is really a very serious issue i have worked in the kurdish autonomous region of iraq already twice even on the border with mosul and what i saw there i did not like at allit is clearly a client state of the west of turkey and to some extent israel it is shamelessly capitalist taking land from its own people cheating them just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil it treats syrian refugees like animals forcing them to make antiassad statements it is turning ancient erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight its military top brass is mainly usuktrained and indoctrinated and it provokes baghdad day and nighti really strongly disliked what i saw there if iraqi kurds were allowed to have their independence  the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative baghdad should not allow it even at the cost of an armed confrontationab coming to the question of the moment the nuclear escalation in north korean and a possible escalation of war on the korean peninsula what is your opinion about kim s strategy and what are the real risksav there is only one real risk and danger that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything i see no other serious problem that the world today is facingwhat is kim s strategy to defend his people by all means against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men women and children of korea that brutal force is the west and its allies it is all very simple but only if one is willing to turn off the bbc and to use his or her own brain it becomes obvious ab according to many for pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like iraq and libya do you not believe that the sanctions of the united nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalationav of course but they sanctions are still imposed on the victim it is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of western demagogues and dictators the world resembles the areas occupied by the nazi germany and italy and japan during the wwii there nobody would dare to vote independently defending victims of fascismab the us federation of science fas estimates that in 2017 north korea has fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch the us possesses 6800 nuclear heads the french and british respectively 300 and 215 respectively included nato s nuclear forces have 7315 nuclear warheads of which 2200 are ready to launch compared to 7000 held by the russians of which 1950 are ready to launch with chinese 270 pakistani 120130 indian 110120 and israeli 80 the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15000 by default the west is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened and so the threatened search to procure them is north korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world as it seems in the mainstream mediaav of course north korea is no threat at all i have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews i visited north korea and mingled with its people there nobody wants war the north korean people paid a terrible price for their independence its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by western forces its women were brutally raped entire villages and towns leveled to the ground or burned to ashes all this is never discussed in the west but is remembered in north koreanow absolutely shameless british propaganda is preparing the world public for the inevitability of the war you know if someone in this day and age still believes that the united states is the only culprit he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed made in europe  most evidently in the uk where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally the british colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister but strategically it is simply brilliant it was utilized for centuries and it even succeeded in programming the brains of the victims in the subcontinent africa and elsewhereof course your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd but day and night people are told that north korea represents a true danger to the world the same was said about the soviet union china cuba iraq afghanistan and many other countries most of these countries have already been destroyednorth korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender to fall on its knees to sacrifice its people it refuses to become a slave for centuries european and later us colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways western culture is after all based and built on slavery it demands absolute compliance unconditional submissionif north korea is attacked it should fight back and it willab the united nations adopted the important treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in july the united nations is often used in alternate ways and countries this treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers including by members of nato with us nuclear weapons including italy nato has banned member states from ratifying it can the west have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like saddam and gaddafiav the west is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city to rape everything that moves burn the center loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders a few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall and they catch him and judge him and feel totally morally righteous it is all so comical but that is not how you are supposed to see itab russia and china with iran venezuela and many other countries are intensifying dedollarization in their mutual exchanges does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussionsav yes definitely and you should talk about it to my friend peter koenig a true dissident a former economist at the world bank who is now actually advising many countries on dedollarizationus dollars should not be used anymore western institutions should be ignored totally new structures should be and are being erected china and russia are of course in the lead all this is extremely important and can change the world in the near futureab venezuela with the convening of the constituent assembly turned off the coup attempts of the opposition in brazil lula is favored in polls while in argentina the former president cristina fernandez is back in the senate with strong popular support so it was not the end of the progressive cycle as the mainstream has for years statedav of course it was not the end the desire of lain americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong it cannot be destroyed overnightthere were some serious setbacks in argentina and brazil and venezuela is suffering immensely battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad but the country is still standingin brazil temer is immensely unpopular his constitutional coup will soon backfire pt will be back in its old form or in a new one and it will be much stronger than before the same goes for argentina you see despite all the media manipulation propaganda and

Santilli Freed Under Plea Pact as Vegas Shooting Casts Shadow on Bundy Trial, long shadow the wake of the recent mass tragedy in las vegas has overtaken various current events including the bundy trial image mandalay bay hotel  resort by mark anderson the truth houndlas vegas although the ongoing bundy trial in the us district court in las vegas nevada has had its share of dramatic changes that s especially true latelya major twist is that internetradio personality pete santilli one of seven defendants in the trial that had been set to begin with jury selection on oct 10th before it was delayed again plead guilty on friday oct 6 and was released pending sentencing confirmed his attorney chris rasmussen of las vegasrancher cliven bundy held without trial for over 18 monthsin that highly anticipated trial with santilli now excluded due to his plea the federal government is trying elder rancher cliven bundy image left his sons ammon and ryan and militia leader ryan payne two other defendants o scott drexler and eric parker who are being retried for a third time from earlier proceedings will join the others in this second of three planned trialsanother development affecting the trial is concern that the oct 1st mass shooting at mandalay bay hotel might prevent the defendants from getting a fair shake according to ryan payne s attorney the vegas shooting has the potential to bias jurors and has asked that the trial be moved to nevada s second largest city reno located seven hours north of las vegasbut while moving the proceedings 450 miles away to reno s federal court appears unlikely as of this writing the las vegas federal court issued yet another delay in this complicated trial therefore the previously announced oct 10 date for jury selection for the second trial will be changed to on or around oct 30thand even that could be subject to change again given the already bumpy track record of this multipledefendant case in which the federal government has had a hard time making its allegations stickonly gregory burleson who s wheelchairbound and reportedly has developed blindness has been sentenced to 68 years no less he was convicted in the first trial that began in early february a codefendant in that trial todd engel is expected to be sentenced dec 22 though several other defendants have been cleared of numerous chargessantilli s journeysantilli who shot extended livestream video footage at the malheur national wildlife refuge building near burns oregon was held on remand for his role in that latter2015 early2016 affairthe controversial internet radio personality has had his share of critics both in and out of the court room some critics alleged that his some of the journalistic coverage shot in oregon enabled the government to more closely monitor the bundys and their supporters who had peacefully occupied the abandoned building to protest onerous federal land controls and the unlawful arrest of the hammonds local ranchers who had fallen foul of federal agents from the bureau of land management blm others however felt his coverage would have provided a helpful account of events had federal agents decided to take the building by force during the oregon hearings his defense attorney argued that much footage which he had broadcast on his youtube channel should be considered as protected speech under the first amendmenton the eve of last september s oregon trial santilli had all charges dismissed against himalthough later cleared of oregonrelated charges santilli remained in federal custody and was transferred to nevada to stand trial for his role in the famous spring 2014 standoff at bundy ranch in bunkerville nevada an event that saw cliven bundy his sons and other supporters gather to protest the policies of the blm and other agenciesfederal agents unsuccessfully attempted to confiscate cliven s cattle over alleged claims that he owed significant federal grazing fees and concerning a epa court order over a contested environmental mitigation policy concerned the relocation of the desert tortoise from the onset of the controversy cliven bundy has maintained the federal government lacks jurisdiction in that part of southern nevada and that the fees don t apply citing legal and historical matterssantilli released before the trialin nevada santilli pleaded guilty to count 2 a single felony count of obstruction of justice based on the government s claim that he used his own vehicle to impede the movement of an approaching blm convoy during the attempted cattle impoundment interestingly during that incident after the convoy stopped federal agents and their guard dogs were then confronted by members of the bundy family and their supporters santilli then filmed the altercation including federal agents tasering ammon bundy and posted it on youtube which went instantly viral garnering nearly 15 million views in just a few days the video was then syndicated on fox news and other national outlets many had credited santilli s original video entitled ranch riot as one of the key catalysts for the one thousand or so supporters and militia who then arrived at bundy ranch over the following 72 hours before the standoff on april 12 2014like all the other defendants he was initially charged with all 16 counts contained in the original federal complaint which carried a potential maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction for all or most of those countsinterestingly santilli s attorney mr rasmussen motioned in court and later told this writer that the government may consider the prison time that santilli has already served behind bars since jan 26 2016 as either sufficient punishment for that felony charge in a bestcase scenario or the court may at least consider giving him credit for that time served even if he s given a longer sentence at his expected sentencing hearing on jan 11 2018 at 8 amplea bargain detailsa reading of the plea agreement shows that the government reserves the right to impose a longer prison term possibly six years on santillialso rasmussen noted that residing judge gloria navarro is not bound by the agreement s recommendations meaning she could choose to alter them when she sentences santillimeanwhile two pending defense motions one to exclude oregonrelated evidence in the government s nevada case against santilli and another to challenge the government s claim that santilli could not excuse his nevada actions because of his journalistic background have become moot due to this plea bargain rasmussen addedthe agreement s terms may raise the question of whether the other defendants actions will be seen in a more negative light given the fact that santilli s guilty plea to the felonyobstruction charge requires under penalty of perjury that he accept the following governmentsourced narrative as true and correct the maximum penalty for conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer as this count against santilli is formally named under 18 usc 372 is six years imprisonment a fine of 250000 or bothbut in the shifting sands of these proceedings the understanding at this juncture is that santilli will owe neither a fine nor restitution nor will there be forfeiture of his assets provided he meets the terms of his release until he s sentenced although according to rasmussen santilli will not be electronically monitored despite speculation that he would be taggedreturning to internet radionotably santilli who is expected to return to his hometown of cincinnati ohio during the week starting monday oct 16 will reportedly be allowed at least for the time being to resume broadcasting his news contentasked if santilli would be able to comment on the bundy trial itself rasmussen replied in writing he can do whatever he wants as long as he s not committing crimes the first amendment allows him to comment on anything unless it is threatening or inciting violence furthermore attorney rasmussen said that santilli is under a selfimposed gag order not a governmentimposed one meaning he has chosen not to talk to reportersalso santilli will not testify against the other defendants and will not have to turn over his journalistic work products but only raw discovery information from court proceedings and the plea bargain stresses he must remain crimefree regarding federal state and local laws and among other things must avoid any known association with anyone who s breaking any law the plea agreement also restricts him from significant travel initially only between southern nevada and cincinnati ohionor can santilli possess a gun or any other item deemed by the government as a weapon just failing to show up for a hearing or some

Another Revision in Las Vegas Mass Shooting – Amid Mandalay Bay Security Guard’s Media Silence,shawn helton 21st century wirefor the second time this week las vegas police officials and the fbi have revised significant timeline details associated with the las vegas mass shooting what does this latest change meannote the las vegas mass shooting currently modern america s deadliest has already been cycled out of most trending media reports in less than two weeks as most mainstream outlets have now focused the public s attention on a readytogo show trial involving disgraced hollywood movie mogul harvey weinstein while abuse of any kind is abhorrent you have to wonder why the las vegas massacre has seemingly been flushed out of the mainstream coverage so rapidly following a media frenzy collapse of a hollywood insiderover the past 24 hours independent reportage by former project veritas operative laura loomer suggests that the campos family may have had a gag order placed on them concerning details related to the las vegas shooting case however official confirmation of this aspect of the case is still pendingthis story follows yet another major shift in the las vegas shooting timeline as accounts on social media also suggest that some from independent media were kept out of the latest las vegas press conferencesee also the las vegas mass shooting more to the story than we ve been toldincredibly police and fbi have once again revised timeline details associated with mandalay bay security guard jesus campos and the alleged shooter now stating that the guard s encounter with the suspected gunman started near the same time as the concert mass shootingunsure lombardo looks down in doubt as overseer fbi special agent aaron rouse keeps a watchful eye over the struggling sheriffwatch below as a noticeably agitated las vegas sheriff joseph lombardo now claims that the 959 time frame is when campos supposedly investigated a nearby door alarm on the 32nd floor as previously reported when this story first brokethe las vegas review journal confirms the sheriff said monday that stephen paddock shot mandalay bay security guard jesus campos at 959 pm about six minutes before the gunman turned his weapons on the route 91 harvest festival crowd below his hotel suite he previously reported campos was shot after the attack on the concert crowd here s the latest lvmpd press conference concerning the las vegas mass shooting on october 13th one of the more disturbing aspects of the aftermath of the las vegas mass shooting has been the production of emotionally charged press conferences that have inundated viewers with endless canned talking points constant revisions of timeline details and reversed statements all serving to continually cloud the official storylombardo also lashed out at critics of the investigation in the public space the word incompetence has been brought forward he said and i am absolutely offended with that characterization review journalto the casual observer you have to wonder why they haven t been able to keep a straight story if the police are getting such basic elements of the story wrong then the public has to ask what else have they got wrongthis type of ritualized media grandstanding has become an almost mechanical hallmark following most largescale active shooter and first responder events as it usually dissolves into more of a media parade meant to convince the public of certain details of a crime rather than address forensic anomalies which clearly don t add upwhile law enforcement looks to tie up loose ends and shore up any early holes or bizarre theories it s possible that a more thorough analysis of all the forensic data in the case will be pushed into the background as any new information may be introduced to steer those critical of the official storyover the past 24 hours reports state that campos who was scheduled for at least five tv interviews abruptly disappeared prior to those appearances one such interview included a fox news interview with sean hannity this twist in the las vegas shooting has added another bizarre aspect to an already strange case here s fox news below the mandalay bay security guard shot by stephen paddock in the moments leading up to the worst mass shooting in modern us history was set to break his silence thursday night with five television interviews including one on fox news campos union president saidexcept when the cameras were about to roll and media gathered in the building to talk to him campos reportedly bolted and as of early friday morning it wasn t immediately clear where he was we were in a room and we came out and he was gone campos union president told reporters according to abc news stephanie wash the motive for the las vegas mass shooting crime still remains unclear  21wire associate editor shawn helton is a researcher and writer specializing in forensic analysis of highprofile crime scene and counter terrorism

US Gov’t War on RT: Imperial Media ‘Truth’ Monopoly Threatens Press Diversity,taking the mickey rt uk billboard campaign on london underground pokes fun at usled russiagate campaign of hysteriaphilip giraldi unz reviewsomehow everything keeps coming back around to russia in one of its recent initiatives the justice department doj appears to be attacking the first amendment as part of the apparent bipartisan program to make vladimir putin the fall guy for everything that goes wrong in washington in the past month the doj has revealed that the fbi is investigating russian owned news outlets sputnik news and rt international and has sent letters to the latter demanding that one of its business affiliates register as a foreign agent by october 17th the apparent line of inquiry that the bureau is pursuing is that both are agencies of the russian government and that both have been spreading disinformation that is intended to discredit the united states government and its institutions this alleged action would make them in the doj view a propaganda arm of a foreign government rather than a news service it also makes them subject to department of the treasury oversight under the foreign agents registration act of 1938sputnik which is owned by a russian government media group headed by putin consigliere dimitri kiselyov has been under investigation due to the accusations made by a fired broadcaster named andrew feinberg feinberg the former sputnik white house correspondent reportedly took with him a thumb drive containing some thousands of internal business files when he left his office he has been interviewed by the fbi has turned over his documents and has claimed that much of the direction over what the network covered came from moscowrt america more television oriented than sputnik operates through two business entities rttv america and rttv studios the department of justice has refused to identify which of the businesses has been targeted by a letter calling for registration under fara but it is believed to be rttv america which provides both operational support of the broadcasting as well as the production facilities both companies are actually owned by russianamerican businessman alex yazlovsky though the funding for them presumably comes from the russian governmenti have noticed very little pushback in the us mainstream and alternative media regarding the department of justice moves presumably because there is a broad consensus that the russians have been interfering in our democracy and have had it coming if that assumption on my part is correct the silence over the issue reflects a certain na vete while also constituting a near perfect example of a pervasive tunnel vision that obscures the significant collateral damage that might be forthcomingnews organizations are normally considered to be exempt from the requirements of fara the department of justice action against the two russian major media outlets is unprecedented insofar as i could determine even qatar owned aljazeera which was so vilified during the early stages of the afghan war that it had its kabul offices bombed by the us did not have to register under fara was permitted to operate freely and was even allowed to buy a television channel license for its american operationsthe doj is in effect saying that rt and sputnik are nothing more than propaganda organs and do not qualify as journalism i would have to disagree if one goes by the standards of contemporary journalism in the united states america s selfdescribed newspapers of record the new york times and the washington post pretend that they have a lock on stories that are true the post has adopted the slogan democracy dies in darkness while the times proclaims the truth is more important now than ever but anyone who has read either paper regularly for the past year knows perfectly well that they have been as often as not leading propaganda organs for hillary clinton and the democratic party pushing a particular agenda and denigrating donald trump they differ little from the admittedly biased television news reporting provided by fox news and msnbcwhat exactly did the russians do according to last january s report signed off on by the fbi cia and nsa which may have motivated the doj to take action rt and sputnik consistently cast presidentelect trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional us media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment well they certainly got that one right and did better in their reporting of what was going on among the american public than either the washington post or new york timesregarding sputnik feinberg claimed inter alia that he was pushed to ask questions at white house press briefings suggesting that syria s bashar alassad was not responsible for some of the chemical attacks that had taken place one wonders at feinberg s reluctance as sputnik and rt were not the only ones expressing skepticism over the claims of syrian involvement which have been widely debunked and why is expressing a credible alternative view on an event in syria even regarded as propaganda damaging to the american publicthere is a difficult to distinguish line between fara restricted trying to influence opinion using what is regarded a fake news and propaganda and legitimate journalism reporting stories where the facts have been challenged even real journalists choose to cover stories selectively inevitably producing a certain narrative for the viewer listener or reader all news services do that to a greater or lesser extenti have considerable personal experience of rt in particular and to a lesser extent with sputnik i also know many others who have been interviewed by one or both no one who has done so has ever been coached or urged to follow a particular line or support a specific position insofar as i know nor do i know anyone who has actually been paid to appear most of us who are interviewed are appreciative of the fact that we are allowed to air views that are essentially banned on the mainstream media to include critique of maladroit policies in places like syria and afghanistan and biting critiques of the war on terrorsputnik in my opinion does however lean heavily towards stories that are critical of the united states and its policies while rt has a global reach and is much more balanced in what it covers for sure it too criticizes us policies and is protective of the russian government but it does not substantially differ from other national news services that i have had done interviews for i find as much uniquely generated negative reporting about the us usually linked to violence or guns on bbc world news france24 and deutsche welle as i do on rt international to describe it as part of an influence campaign driven by a staterun propaganda machine has a kernel of truth but it is nevertheless a bit of a stretch since one could make the same claims about any government financed news service including voice of america governments only get into broadcasting to promote their points of view not to inform the publicthere is a serious problem in the threats to use fara as it could advance the ongoing erosion of freedom of the press in the united states by establishing the precedent that a foreign news services that is critical of the us will no longer be tolerated it is also hypocritical in that countries like israel that interfere regularly in american politics are exempt from fara registration because no one dares to take such a step while russia is fair gamegoing after news outlets also invites retaliation against us media operating in russia and eventually elsewhere currently western media reports from russia pretty much without being censored or pressured to avoid certain stories i would note a recent series that appeared on cbs featuring the repulsive stephen colbert spending a week in russia which mercilessly lampooned both the country and its government no one arrested him or made him stop filming no one claimed that he was trying to undermine the russian government or discredit the country s institutions even though that is precisely what he was doingand then there is the issue of the threat posed by news media outlets like rt and sputnik even combined the two services have limited access to the us market with a 2014 study suggesting that they have only 28 million actual weekly viewers rt did not make the cut and is not included on the list of 100 most popular television channels in the us and it has far less market penetration than other foreign news services like the bbc it can be found on only a limited number of cable networks in a few mostly urban areas it does better in europe but its profile in the us market is miniscule as even bad news is good news in terms of selling a product it probably did receive higher ratings when the intelligence agency report slamming it came out on it in january everyone probably wanted to learn what rt was all aboutso it seems to me that the united states moves against rt and sputnik are little more than lashing out at a problem that is not really a problem in a bid to again promote the russian threat to explain the ongoing dysfunction that prevails in america s democratic process one keeps reading or hearing how the american government has indisputable proof of moscow s intentions to subvert democracy in the us as well as in europe but the actual evidence is still elusive will russiagate end with a bang or a whimper no one seems to

“Russia Did It” is Smokescreen for Big Business Ownership of US Government and Congress,finian cunningham sputnikgoogle is the latest us internet company to claim it found russialinked advertisements on its network allegedly posted to influence the us presidential election last yeartwitter and facebook have already made similar claims and all three are now facing more scrutiny in the coming weeks before congressional committeeswhat is truly astounding about this hysteria over alleged russian interference in us democracy is that american citizens are being distracted from what is by far the much more alarming issue of how their government and congress is bought by us big businessbloomberg reported this week that google identifies russian election interference network  it said the internet giant found political ads worth 4700 which it believes are tied to the russian government  these ads it is claimed carried political articles which were meant to influence which way american citizens would vote in the presidential contest between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump last novembergoogle has reportedly said that another 53000 worth of ads are under review for suspicion of being linked to the russian government this follows claims made by facebook that it had earlier identified 100000 spent on ads by russian sources while twitter said it had located 274000 worth of such adsthe russian government has repeatedly rejected accusations that it tried to meddle in the us election moscow rightly highlights the dearth of any evidence and total lack of due legal process the american allegations have also whipped up a toxic climate to curb the legitimate media activities of russian news channelsit is understood that russia s stateowned news channel rt promoted some of its content through social media like facebook and twitter but as rt editor margarita simonyan pointed out such promotion is entirely normal for all news media companies she estimated that usbased outlets probably spent much more than rt promoting their content through the russian section of twitterseveral issues about this russian meddling trope are patently dodgy yet are bizarrely overlookedthe first is that as with other claims of russian interference in the us election no evidence is ever presented facebook twitter and google are making vague claims of accounts believed to be tied to the russian government  and the us news media simply repeat these nebulous claims without further questiona second anomaly is that congressional committees that have been investigating allegations of russian interference have also not presented any evidence after nearly nine months of intensive probingsenators richard burr and mark warner who are heading up a select intelligence committee made a big presentation last week in washington on their findings the findings turned out to be an embarrassing anticlimax the congressmen admitted they found no evidence of russia collusion in the election and baldly asserted that moscow s influence campaign continues which they will continue to investigate no doubt at a huge cost to american taxpayersso russia is being accused of interfering in the presidential elections on the basis of the allegation alone and yet american politicians are also contradicting themselves by saying that the alleged interference did not alter the vote outcomebut here is the biggest absurdity the sums of money claimed to have been used by russia to destabilize us democracy are ridiculously minusculefor argument sake let s go along with the claims that somehow russian agents took out ads on social media to influence the us election between facebook twitter and google the expenditure amounts to about 300000that figure is a pittance compared with the avalanche of money that us corporations doled out to bankroll the election campaigns of the two candidatesaccording to bloomberg hillary clinton s election bid was leveraged with 12 billion from superpacs political action campaigns trump received less corporate money raising a total of 647 million or about half of what clinton s coffers receivednow put those figures into perspective the alleged russian influence ads costing around 300000 represent some 001 percent of what us corporations actually spent 18 billion total in promoting either clinton or trump for the white house in other words the much speculated and highly dubious financial outlay that russian sources allocated to allegedly upset the american democratic process is negligible compared with the actual money spent by major american companies to determine the 2016 election outcomewhile american media and politicians are endeavoring to get citizens all worked up about kremlin meddling the glaring fact is that their democratic process is subject to enormous us corporate influence and not just the 2016 election every presidential cyclenote too that this is only taking into consideration the corporate lobbying in the presidential contest every year it is calculated that us companies spend about 3 billion lobbying federal government and congressthat is every year year after year big business in america spends 10000fold on influencing lawmakers and government policy compared with the alleged ad campaign that russia supposedly engaged inanother source of major influence on american politicians are the lobby groups funded separately by the israeli and saudi government interests each year these foreign states spend an estimated 57 million on lobbying members of the us congress and the federal government this is real money with real impact on us democracy as opposed to alleged russian interferencegetting back to lobbying by us companies some might call it bribery among the biggest donors are the military manufacturing firms according to american publication the hill included in the top 50 corporate lobbies plying congress with campaign funds are boeing lockheed martin and northrup grummananother major lobby although not in the top 50 is the national rifle association nra which promotes gun ownership for private citizens by donating to congress membersthree recent events show how corporate money effectively buys american government policypresident trump is pushing for an overhaul of tax policy which will result in the biggest ever tax benefit to corporate americasecondly with regard to the us military budget the congress is due to pass a record increase amounting to 700 billion annually this largesse to pentagonconnected manufacturers like lockheed martin and boeing is no doubt fueled by trump using reckless bellicose rhetoric towards north korea threatening war instead of a diplomatic solutionthirdly in the aftermath of the latest mass shooting

Agent Angelina: Are CIA Using Hollywood’s Jolie as Soft Power Operative?,21st century wire says in previous articles 21wire has consistently raised the question of whether or not the cia and the pentagon have been using hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas this charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a conspiracy theory even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice and one with historic precedents seems that the mainstream claim that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that won t fly anymore we have talked about dennis rodman and george clooney as two highprofile ambassadors of the us inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various pr strategic or intelligence endsthis latest admission regarding actress angelina jolie is even more telling where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive and possibly nonexistent joseph kony of the lord s resistance army in the jungles of ugandaandrew korybko oriental reviewit s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes cia psyop narratives in her films but this time new leaks allege that angelina jolie had also at one time considered being the pentagon s bait to catch kony  which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities foreign policy forays such as dennis rodman s friendship with kim jongun agent angelinaangelina jolie is the poster woman for the hollywoodintelligence complex  the perfect example of a willing cia asset who regularly goes along with deep state narratives in her films such as the antiserb production in the land of blood and honey  she s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for humanitarian interventions abroad or in other words imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated humanitarian reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in darfur jolie often visits us troops abroad like in afghanistan though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefieldthat s no longer the case anymore though according to a report by the sunday times a ukbased media outlet which claims to have read leaked international criminal court icc documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal african warlord joseph kony the sunday times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall however so the average information consumer needs to rely on secondhand sources such as people magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge according to the celebrity news site a hoard of 40000 icc documents leaked to the french investigative website mediapart reveals that jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal ugandan warlord joseph konyshe has the idea to invite kony to dinner and then arrest him reads an email sent by former icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo reports the sunday times forget other celebrities she is the one moreno ocampo adds in another email she loves to arrest kony she is ready probably brad pitt will go also according to the sunday times which has seen the mediapart documents moreno ocampo hoped that jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the central african republic with a team of us special forcesit was thought that their presence would then draw kony out of his armored compound and enable the us forces to take him into custody if these allegations are true then it would mean that jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of hollywood operatives to an infield asset of the pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission truth be told catching kony  as the viral 2012 slogan went isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native uganda the democratic republic of the congo south sudan and the central african republic in fact the whole purpose of the cia psyop to catch kony was to justify us special forces presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in south sudan and the central african republic which would turn them into a failed state belt that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a chinesebuilt bicoastal silk road through their resourcerich territoriesthe geopolitics of the kony diversion aren t the focus of this article so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this hybrid war campaign instead it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the deep state  both in the propaganda and as can now be seen infield operational manifestations thus far it doesn t seem like any of jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a highprofile covert mission but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example it s certainly possible that other famous people are doing something similar in serving their governmentsodd couple joseph kony  angelina joliethe rodmankim casethe most relevant case that comes to mind is dennis rodman who s the us kim whisperer in passing along messages through what he calls basketball diplomacy but who actually functions as the best american pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive north korean leader in person it s been speculated for a few years already that rodman might indeed be working for the cia but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either too stupid or that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that  but these critics never take the time to consider that rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushedup drug bust or something of that naturein any case his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with kim jongun although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur otto warmbier s release shortly before his death given that the american student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine he probably would have been released whether rodman came to the country or not but it s very telling that kim jongun refused to meet with his best friend during this time incidentally it was shortly after this that the war of words and insult diplomacy between the north korean and american leaders really took off which might have been inspired by trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious rodmankim connection because pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up toalthough it s only speculation at this point it would indeed explain why trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the madman theory in dealing with kim jongun as the us intelligence community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his north korean counterpart with rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful the us might have feared that kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking north korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear testthe above narrative might sound dubious upon first read but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that angelina jolie was working with the pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to catch kony  which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that dennis rodman might have been doing similar field work for the cia in collecting valuable personal intelligence about kim jonguneven if the north koreans are actually aware of what rodman is up to nowadays that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the hermit kingdom  as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the us deep state continue this story at oriental reviewread more hollywood news at 21st century wire hollywood

Iran ‘Will Respond’ if US Moves to Designate Revolutionary Guard as ‘Terrorist Group’,fresh off its humiliating sixyearlong debacle in syria and with very few viable wars within its grasp the pentagon along with the israeli lobbyled us congress and senate are now trying to tighten the noose on iranfor the last 3 weeks hawkish republican senators have been pressuring president donald trump to decertify the iran nuclear deal in october and to reimpose harsh sanctions despite the fact that iran is in full compliance with the international p51 brokered nuclear containment agreementaccording

nuclear agreement makes little sense business insider explainsjohn glaser and emma ashford respond to trump s latest attack on the nuclear deal iran is clearly abiding by the deal s requirements as president trump himself has twice formally acknowledged but the president appears determined to ignore us allies his own intelligence community and the international atomic energy agency which has affirmed eight separate times in detailed reports that iran is in compliance with the dealas is usually the case the us hawks also supported by iran s economic and geopolitical regional rival saudi arabia are hoping to trigger retaliatory rhetoric from the iranian hawks and use those words to justify a call for escalation of tension and a full range of new sanctions against iranthis desire to withdraw from the jcpoa is difficult to explain whatever trump s reasoning this much is clear all of america s options outside the jcpoa carry unacceptably high risks and threaten to exacerbate the

"REVEALED: FBI Aided, Abetted ‘ISIS’ Terrorist Attack at ‘Mohammed Cartoon Event’ in Garland, Texas",daily shooter 21st century wirejust as isis is being routed in deir ezzor syria and soon out of raqqa and driven from its remaining strongholds in iraq we discover how the us government has been busy keeping the organization thriving within its own shoreswhat you are about to read is simply breathtaking but should be of no surprise to our readers these new court findings reaffirms much of what 21wire and the daily shooter column have been reporting for the last five years that the fbi is responsible for the majority of socalled terrorist attacks in the usaccording to a new legal case filed against the fbi court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged home grown isis attack to take place in garland texas on may 4 2015 international criminal lawyer jennifer breedon shows the fbi was complicit in the attack and even enticed the two terrorists to carry out the attack and where agents had pretended to be isis in order to keep their entrapment operation going she explains some of the facts are indicating that they had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with isis trying to find out these isis groups and he wanted to make himself higher up in isis ranks to know more of their fighters apparently he stayed in the car behind them which came out in another case filing with the fbi they did not prevent it because if the attack had been carried out successfully and people died it was likely this undercover agent and his supervisors in the fbi felt that this would promote him up to high ranks within isis the undercover agent would be promoted up because the attack was then successful read breddon s full interview hereon the surface this is a clear case of entrapment by the fbi but upon deeper examination it s now clear that the fbi seems to have aided and abetted a terrorist attack on us soilwhile other mainstream and alternative media outlets were busy promulgating the official narrative 21wire actually calledout the staged event designed to leverage a far right antimuslim agenda and stoke irrational fears of endless isis attacks on us soilprovocateur professional provocateur geller provided the pr bait for media the fbirun american isis cellthe contrived event was marketed as a controversial muhammad art exhibit and cartoon contest organized by a cutout politcal front group american freedom defense initiative led by antimuslim activist and professional provocateur pamela geller and featured farright dutch politician geert wilders as its keynote speaker media personality geller claimed to have purposely chosen the venue following the council on americanislamic relations cair gathering who held a stand with the prophet conference in late january 2015 after the charlie hebdo shootings in paris earlier that yearaccording to the victim s attorney breedon the fbi had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with isis trying to find out these isis groups and he wanted to make himself higher up in isis ranks to know more of their fighters american journalist trevor aaronson further explains the derelict role of james comey image left in fbi s attempt to cover its own fingerprints on this dodgy operation hours earlier the fbi had sent a bulletin to local police with elton simpson s photo warning that he was interested in the event fbi director james comey said in a press conference following the shooting that the fbi did not have reason to believe simpson was planning to attack the event even though the bureau had spent years trying to build a case against him entrapment the unwitting youngster elton simpson was groomed by a paid fbi informant and brought to the scene of the staged attack after the fbistaged attack  21wire was one of few media outlets to report how a paid fbi informant was not only handling  but directing what appeared to be a naive and vulnerable federal target for entrapment a new young muslim convert named elton simpson from phoenix arizonait s now been revealed that gunman  elton simpson was already under surveillance by the fbi and was even the subject of a terror investigation more importantly we can also confirm simpson was being handled by an fbi informant court papers filed in arizona name the fbi undercover informant as mr daba deng a kenyan and who from 2007 was paid 132000 by the fbi to become friends with mr simpson  and who appears to have groomed simpson through a local mosque and helped to develop simpson s ideas about jihad so keen was cnn at the time to convince its audience that garland was a real terrorist event it took the trouble of creating its own cartoon version of the attack in a desperate attempt to make the official story believablesynthetic terror cnn uses cartoon to make the garland shooting look like a real terror eventat the time and almost comically cnn tried to push the official narrative appearing totally clueless of the fact that the attackers were under fbi supervision for years he wasn t wellknown to federal law enforcement and was not on the fbi s radar one of the officials said investigators were combing through evidence retrieved from the shooters arizona home to help piece together a timeline of how their plot came together the official said it was as if cnn had copied and pasted their report from an fbi press memo issued after the event perhaps it was cnn s coverage of the event was equally ridiculous not picking up on the fact that a small platoon of heavily armed us special ops mercenaries were prepositioned at geller s event in anticipation of the madefortv terror attack that followedbreaking update from swat team leader wfaachannel8 pictwittercomhof5f4bf7u jobin panicker jobinpnews may 4 2015see our initial report on geller s garland hoax hebdo redux in garland texas mohammed cartoon shooting reeks of a staged false flaggarland was a clear case of the us government creating a terror threat where there was none and this wouldn t be the first time eitheras previously noted the guardian reported on the scale and scope of this trend in 2014 in some cases the fbi may have created terrorists out of lawabiding individuals by suggesting the idea of taking terrorist action or encouraging the target to act the list of fbirelated terrorist incidents inside the us is a long one the formula for creating a terror icon required a confidential informant to guide and manage the future suspect right up to the point of arrest or in some cases like the world trade center bombing in 1993 the fbi have even allowed the terrorist incident to take placein garland as with so many other high profile terror and mass shooting events 21wire s investigations have turned out to

Henningsen: Obama White House Colluded with Facebook to Fabricate ‘Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,washington dc this week the senate intelligence committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 election if anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented they would have been sorely disappointed again still that s not going to stop official washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory the issue of collusion is still open said committee chairman richard burr of north carolina r we have more work to do as it relates to collusion but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened likewise the committee s ranking democrat senator mark warner of virginia admitted they had nothing but implored americans to be on guard of the russian the russian active measures did not end on election day 2016 said warner he maintains that the us should adopt a more aggressive whole government approach to combat russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting americanshowever yesterday 21wire revealed via consortium news that it was senator warner along with the obama white house who colluded with silicon valley giant facebook in 2016 with warner making multiple trips to palo alto to pressure facebook to produce some evidence that warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of russian bots using facebook to interfere in the 2016 election as it turns out this was fake news fabricated by washington and its mainstream media partners21wire editor patrick henningsen spoke to rt international yesterday about these developments and how the us government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere by definition that collusion between big government and corporations is classic fascism watch what i will confirm is that the russian intelligence service is determined clever senator burr said and i recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously russiagate has really turned into a vaudeville actread more russiagate news at 21st century wire russiagate filessupport 21wire subscribe  become a member  21wiretv,Middle-east,6-Oct-17,0
Fake News: The Collapse of the MSM’s ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Story,as 21wire said last year the russian hacking or russiagate story was a political hoax from the start what this story can now demonstrate is that for the last 18 months the entire mainstream media has been promulgating a highly politicised and relentless campaign of fake news designed to implicate russia in an imaginary scandal leading the pack are former papers of record the new york times and the washington post flanked by america s premier broadcast tv propaganda outlet cnnlast week we revealed how powerful politicians in washington had pressured facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling demonstrating clear collusion between the obama administration and silicon valley corporation facebook with the goal of fabricating a scandal in order to scapegoat vladimir putin and the russians for the electoral collapse of hillary clinton last novemberas a result usrussian relations have been sacrificed at the altar of petty partisan politics and a failing deep state agendait certainly begs the question with so much at stake why would washington and msm lie and risk pushing global tensions closer to a world war level confrontation if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie aboutconsortium news exclusive the us mainstream media is determined to prove russiagate despite the scandal s cracking foundation and its inexplicable anomalies such as why russia would set up a facebook puppies pageby robert parrywhat is perhaps most unprofessional unethical and even immoral about the us mainstream media s coverage of russiagate is how all the stories start with the conclusion russia bad and then make whatever shards of information exist fit the preordained narrativefor instance we re told that facebook executives who were sent back three times by democratic lawmakers to find something to pin on russia finally detected 100000 worth of ads spread out over three years from accounts suspected of links to russia or similar hazy wordingthese facebook ads and 201 related twitter accounts we re told represent the longmissing proof about russian meddling in the us presidential election after earlier claims faltered or fell apart under even minimal scrutinyin the old days journalists might have expressed some concern that facebook found the ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians such as sen mark warner dvirginia the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry but today s mainstream reporters took warner s side and made it look like facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out therehowever it doesn t really seem to matter how little evidence there is anything will doeven the paltry 100000 is not put in any perspective facebook has annual revenue of 27 billion nor the 201 twitter accounts compared to twitter s 328 million monthly users nor are the hazy allegations of suspected links to russia subjected to serious inspection although russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests it s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by president vladimir putinyet if you look at some of the details about these 100000 in ads you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought the sum was spread out over 2015 2016 and 2017 and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of facebook activitybut more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before americans went to the polls last november according to facebook that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwardsfacebook added that roughly 25 of the ads were never shown to anyone for 50 of the ads less than 3 was spent for 99 of the ads less than 1000 was spent so as miniscule as the 100000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaignwhat about the puppieswe further have learned that most ads weren t for or against a specific candidate but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the united states and thus somehow undermine american democracyexcept it turns out that one of the issues was puppiesas mike isaac and scott shane of the new york times reported in tuesday s editions the russians who posed as americans on facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises there was even a facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads now there are a lot of controversial issues in america but i don t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list isaac and shane reported that there were also supposedly russialinked groups advocating gay rights gun rights and black civil rights although precisely how these divergent groups were linked to russia or the kremlin was never fully explained facebook declined to offer detailsat this point a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources who presumably include many partisan democrats and their political allies hyping the evilrussia narrative it would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy landyet instead of starting to question the overall premise of this scandal journalists at the new york times the washington post cnn etc keep making excuses for the nuttiness the explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious russians might be probing to discover americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda the goal of the dog lovers page was more obscure isaac and shane acknowledged but some analysts suggested a possible motive to build a large following before gradually introducing political content without viewing the entire feed from the page now closed by facebook it is impossible to say whether the russian operators tried such tactics seriously this is what the new york times is passing off as journalism nowthe joe mccarthy of russiagatethe times then turned to clinton watts a former fbi agent and a top promoter of the new mccarthyism that has swept official washington watts has testified before congress that almost anything that appears on social media these days criticizing a politician may well be

‘Russia Did It’ – The New Age of McCarthyism,robert parry consortium newsmake no mistake about it the united states has entered an era of a new mccarthyism that blames nearly every political problem on russia and has begun targeting american citizens who don t go along with this new cold war propagandaa difference however from the mccarthyism of the 1950s is that this new mccarthyism has enlisted democrats liberals and even progressives in the cause because of their disgust with president trump the 1950s version was driven by republicans and the right with much of the left on the receiving end maligned by the likes of sen joe mccarthy as unamerican and as communism s fellow travelers the real winners in this new mccarthyism appear to be the neoconservatives who have leveraged the democraticliberal hatred of trump to draw much of the left into the political hysteria that sees the controversy over alleged russian political meddling as an opportunity to get trump already the neocons and their allies have exploited the antirussian frenzy to extract tens of millions of dollars more from the taxpayers for programs to combat russian propaganda ie funding of nongovernmental organizations and scholars who target dissident americans for challenging the justifications for this new cold warthe washington post which for years has served as the flagship for neocon propaganda is again charting the new course for america much as it did in rallying us public backing for the 2003 invasion of iraq and in building sympathy for abortive regime change projects aimed at syria and iran the post has begun blaming almost every unpleasant development in the world on russia russia russiafor instance a post editorial on tuesday shifted the blame for the anemic victory of german chancellor angela merkel and the surprising strength of the farright alternative for germany afd from merkel s austerity policies which have caused hardship for much of the working class or from her open door for mideast refugees which has destabilized some workingclass neighborhoods to you guessed it russiathe evidence as usual is vague and selfinterested but sure to be swallowed by many democrats and liberals who hate russia because they blame it for trump and by lots of republicans and conservatives who have a residual hatred for russia left over from the old cold warthe post cited the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab which has been pushing much of the hysteria about alleged russian activities on the internet the atlantic council essentially is nato s think tank and is financed with money from the us government gulf oil states military contractors global financial institutions and many other sources which stand to gain directly or indirectly from the expanding us military budget and nato interventionsblaming russiain this new cold war the russians get blamed for not only disrupting some neocon regime change projects such as the proxy war in syria but also political developments in the west such as donald trump s election and afd s rise in germanythe atlantic council s digital lab claimed according to the post editorial that in the final hours of the german campaign online supporters of the afd began warning their base of possible election fraud and the online alarms were driven by anonymous troll accounts and boosted by a russianlanguage botnet of course the post evinces no evidence tying any of this to the russian government or to president vladimir putin it is the nature of mccarthyism that actual evidence is not required just heavy breathing and dark suspicions for those of us who operate web sites trolls some volunteers and some professionals have become a common annoyance and they represent many political outlooks not just russianplus it is standard procedure these days for campaigns to issue lastminute alarms to their supporters about possible election fraud to raise doubts about the results should the outcome be disappointingthe us government has engaged in precisely this strategy around the world having prous parties not only complain about election fraud but to take to the streets in violent protests to impugn the legitimacy of election outcomes that us strategy has been applied to places such as ukraine the orange revolution in 2004 iran the green revolution in 2009 russia the snow revolution in 2011 and many other locationspreelection alerts also have become a feature in us elections even in 2016 when both donald trump and hillary clinton raised questions about the legitimacy of the balloting albeit for different reasonsyet instead of seeing the afd maneuver as a typical ploy by a relatively minor party and the german election outcome as an understandable reflection of voter discontent and weariness over merkel s three terms as chancellor the atlantic council and the post see russians under every bed and particularly putinloving to hate putinin the world of neocon propaganda putin has become the great b te noire since he has frustrated a variety of neocon schemes he helped head off a major us military strike against syria in 2013 he aided president obama in achieving the iran nuclear agreement in 201415 putin opposed and to a degree frustrated the neoconsupported coup in ukraine in 2014 and he ultimately supplied the air power that defeated neoconbacked rebel forces in syria in 201517so the post and the neocons want putin gone and they have used gauzy allegations about russian meddling in the us and other elections as the new propaganda theme to justify destabilizing russia with economic sanctions and if possible engineering another regime change project in moscownone of this is even secret carl gershman the neocon president of the usgovernmentfunded national endowment for democracy publicly proclaimed the goal of ousting putin in an oped in the washington post writing the united states has the power to contain and defeat this danger the issue is whether we can summon the will to do so but the way neocon propaganda works is that the us and its allies are always the victims of some nefarious enemy who must be thwarted to protect all that is good in the world in other words even as ned and other usfunded operations take aim at putin and russia russia and putin must be transformed into the aggressors mr putin would like nothing better than to generate doubts fog cracks and uncertainty around the german pillar of europe the post editorial said he relishes infiltrating chaos and mischief into open societies in this case supporting the farright afd is extraordinarily cynical given how many millions of russians died to defeat the fascists seven decades ago not to belabor the point but there is no credible evidence that putin did any of this there is a claim by the virulently antirussian atlantic council that some anonymous troll accounts promoted some afd complaint about possible voter fraud and that it was picked up by a russianlanguage botnet even if that is true and the atlantic council is far from an objective source where is the link to putinnot everything that happens in russia a nation of 144 million people is ordered by putin but the post would have you believe that it is it is the centerpiece of this neocon conspiracy theorysilencing dissentsimilarly any american who questions this propaganda immediately is dismissed as a kremlin stooge or a russian propagandist another ugly campaign spearheaded by the post and the neocons again no evidence is required just some analysis that what you re saying somehow parallels something putin has saidon tuesday in what amounted to a companion piece for the editorial a post article again pushed the unproven suspicions about russian operatives buying 100000 in facebook ads from 2015 into 2017 to supposedly influence us politics once again no evidence requiredin the article the post also reminds its readers that moscow has a history of focusing on social inequities in the us which gets us back to the comparisons between the old mccarthyism and the newyes it s true that the soviet union denounced america s racial segregation and cited that ugly feature of us society in expressing solidarity with the american civil rights movement and national liberation struggles in africa it s also true that american communists collaborated with the domestic civil rights movement to promote racial integrationthat was a key reason why j edgar hoover s fbi targeted martin luther king jr and other africanamerican leaders because of their association with known or suspected communists similarly the reagan administration resisted support for nelson mandela because his african national congress accepted communist support in its battle against south africa s apartheid whitesupremacist regimeinterestingly one of the arguments from liberal national democrats in opposing segregation in the 1960s was that the repression of american blacks undercut us diplomatic efforts to develop allies in africa in other words soviet and communist criticism of america s segregation actually helped bring about the demise of that offensive systemyet king s association with alleged communists remained a talking point of diehard segregationists even after his assassination when they opposed creating a national holiday in his honor in the 1980sthese parallels between the old mccarthyism and the new mccarthyism are implicitly acknowledged in the post s news article on tuesday which cites putin s criticism of police killings of unarmed american blacks as evidence that he is meddling in us politics since taking office putin has on occasion sought to spotlight racial tensions in the united states as a means of shaping perceptions of american society the article states putin injected himself in 2014 into the race debate after protests broke out in ferguson mo over the fatal shooting of michael brown an african american by a white police officer do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy in the united states putin told cbs s 60 minutes program if everything was perfect there wouldn t be the problem of ferguson there would be no abuse by the police but our task is to see all these problems and respond properly the post s speculative point seems to be that putin s response included having russian operatives buy some ads on facebook to exploit these racial tensions but there is no evidence to support that conspiracy theoryhowever as this antirussia hysteria spreads we may soon see americans who also protest the police killing of unarmed black men denounced as putin s fellowtravelers much as king and other civil rights leaders were smeared as communist dupes ignoring realityso instead of democrats and chancellor merkel looking in the mirror and seeing the real reasons why many white workingclass voters are turning toward populist and extremist alternatives they can simply blame putin and continue a crackdown on internetbased dissent as the work of russian operatives already under the guise of combating russian propaganda and fake news google facebook and other tech giants have begun introducing algorithms to hunt down and marginalize news that challenges official us government narratives on hotbutton issues such as ukraine and syria again no evidence is required just the fact that putin may have said something similaras democrats liberals and even some progressives join in this russiagate hysteria driven by their hatred of donald trump and his supposedly fascistic tendencies they might want to consider whom they ve climbed into bed with and what these neocons have in mind for the futurearguably if fascism or totalitarianism comes to the united states it is more likely to arrive in the guise of protecting democracy from russia or another foreign adversary than from a realitytv clown like donald trumpthe new mccarthyism with its orwellianstyle algorithms might seem like a clever way to neutralize or maybe even help oust trump but long after trump is gone a structure for letting the neocons and the mainstream media monopolize american political debate might be a far greater threat to both democracy and peaceto read more on the new cold war the 21wire cold war filessupport 21wire subscribe

The ‘New Cold War’ – A Rehash of Old Rivalries, what will the new cold war look like illustration by brad hollandwilliam blum ichthe antirussianantisoviet bias in the american media appears to have no limit you would think that they would have enough selfawareness and enough journalistic integrity  just enough  to be concerned about their image but it keeps on coming piled higher and deeperone of the latest cases in point is a review of a new biography of mikhail gorbachev in the new york times book review september 10 the review says that gorbachev was no hero to his own people because he was the destroyer of their empire  this is how the new york times avoids having to say anything positive about life in the soviet union or about socialism they would have readers believe that it was the loss of the likes of czechoslovakia or hungary et al that upset the russian people not the loss under gorbachev s perestroika of a decent standard of living for all a loss affecting people s rent employment vacations medical care education and many other aspects of the soviet welfare stateaccompanying this review is a quote from a 1996 times review of gorbachev s own memoir which said it mystifies westerners that mikhail gorbachev is loathed and ridiculed in his own country this is the man who pulled the world several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing fear from his countrymen who ended bloody foreign adventures and liberated eastern europe yet his repudiation at home could hardly be more complete his political comeback attempt in june attracted less than 1 percent of the vote thus is gorbachev s unpopularity with his own people further relegated to the category of mystery  and not due to the profound social changesit should be noted that in 1999 usa today reported when the berlin wall crumbled 1989 east germans imagined a life of freedom where consumer goods were abundant and hardships would fade ten years later a remarkable 51 say they were happier with communism earlier polls would likely have shown even more than 51 expressing such a sentiment for in the ten years many of those who remembered life in east germany with some fondness had passed away although even 10 years later in 2009 the washington post could report westerners west berliners say they are fed up with the tendency of their eastern counterparts to wax nostalgic about communist times it was in the postunification period that a new russian and eastern europe proverb was born everything the communists said about communism was a lie but everything they said about capitalism turned out to be the truth the current new york times review twice refers to vladimir putin as authoritarian  as does routinely much of the western media none of the many such references i have come across in recent years has given an example of such authoritarian policies although such examples of course exist as they do under a man named trump and a woman named may and every other government in the world but clearly if a strong case could be made of putin being authoritarian the western media would routinely document such in their attacks upon the russian president why do they notthe review further refers to putin to as the coldeye former kgb lieutenant colonel  one has to wonder if the new york times has ever referred to president george hw bush as the coldeye former cia director just as in the first cold war one of the basic problems is that americans have great difficulty in believing that russians mean well apropos this i d like to recall the following written about george kennan one of the most prominent american diplomats evercrossing poland with the first us diplomatic mission to the soviet union in the winter of 1933 a young american diplomat named george kennan was somewhat astonished to hear the soviet escort foreign minister maxim litvinov reminisce about growing up in a village nearby about the books he had read and his dreams as a small boy of being a librarian we suddenly realized or at least i did that these people we were dealing with were human beings like ourselves kennan wrote that they had been born somewhere that they had their childhood ambitions as we had it seemed for a brief moment we could break through and embrace these people it hasn t happened yetkennan s sudden realization brings george orwell to mind we have now sunk to a depth at which the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men the plague of nationalismthe world has enough countries too goddamn many if you ask me is there room for any more delegations at the united nations any more parking spots in new york have the people of catalonia who are seeking independence from spain in an october 1 vote considered that their new nation will have to open hundreds of new embassies and consulates around the world furnish them all fill them all with paid employees houses and apartments and furniture for many of them several new cars for each diplomatic post how many billions of dollars in taxes will be taken from the catalan people to pay for all thisand what about the military any selfrespecting country needs an army and a navy will the new catalonia be able to afford even halfway decent armed forces the new country will of course have to join nato with its obligatory minimum defense capability there goes a billion or two moreplus what it will have to pay the european union which will simply be replacing madrid in imposing many legal restrictions upon the catalan peopleand for what noble purpose are they rising up freedom democracy civil liberties human rights no it s all for money madrid is taking in more in taxes from catalonia than it returns in services something which can be said about many citystate relationships in the united states presumably there are also some individual catalans who have their odd personal reasonscatalan nationalists insist that selfdetermination is an inalienable right and cannot be curbed by the spanish constitution well then why stop with an autonomous community as catalonia is designated why don t provinces everywhere have the right to declare their independence how about cities or neighborhoods why not my block i could be the presidentand there are many other restive independence movements in the world like the kurds in iraq and turkey in scotland belgium and italy and california lord help us many countries are very reluctant to even recognize a new state for fear that it might encourage their own people to break awayif love is blind nationalism has lost all five senses if nature were a bank they would have already rescued it eduardo galeanous treasury secretary steven mnuchin told a new york investor conference that hurricane irma would ultimately boost the economy by sparking rebuilding there clearly is going to be an impact on gdp in the short run we will make it up in the long run as we rebuild that will help gdp it won t have a bad impact on the economy hmmm very interesting can we therefore assume that if the damage had been twice as bad it would have boosted the economy even moremeanwhile in the nontrump nonfantasy world there is a thing called climate change ie the quality of our lives the survival of the planet what keeps corporations from modifying their behavior so as to be kinder to our environment it is of course the good old bottom line again what can we do to convince the corporations to consistently behave like good citizens nothing that hasn t already been tried and failed except one thing unmentionable in polite company unmentionable in a capitalist society nationalization there i said it now i ll be getting letters addressed to the old stalinist but nationalization is not a panacea either at least for the environment there s the greatest single source of manmade environmental damage in the world the united states military and it s already been nationalized but doing away with private corporations will reduce the drive toward imperialism sufficiently that before long the need for a military will fade away and we can live like costa rica if you think that would put the united states in danger of attack please tell me who would attack and whythe argument i like to use when speaking to those who don t accept the idea that extreme weather phenomena are manmade is thiswell we can proceed in one of two ways1 we can do our best to limit the greenhouse effect by curtailing greenhouse gas emissions carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere and if it turns out that these emissions were not in fact the cause of all the extreme weather phenomena then we ve wasted a lot of time effort and money although other benefits to the ecosystem would still accrue2 we can do nothing at all to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and if it turns out that these emissions were in fact the leading cause of all the extreme weather phenomena not simply extreme but getting downright freaky then we ve lost the earth and life as we know itso are you a gamblerthe new vietnam documentaryat the beginning of ken burns new documentary on the american war in vietnam the narrator says the war was begun in good faith by decent people out of fateful misunderstandings american overconfidence and cold war misunderstandings the early american involvement in vietnam can be marked by two things in particular 1 helping the french imperialists in their fight against the forces led by ho chi minh of north vietnam and 2 the cancellation of the elections that would have united north and south vietnam as one nation because the us and its south vietnam allies knew that ho chi minh would win it was that simplenothing of good faith or decency in that scenario no misunderstandings ho chi minh was a great admirer of america and its declaration of independence his own actual declaration of 1945 begins with the familiar all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but ho chi minh was what was called a communist  it was that simple see the vietnam chapter in my book killing hope for the detailsdaniel ellsberg s conclusion about the us in vietnam it wasn t that we were on the wrong side we were the wrong side ms hillaryshe has a new book out and lots of interviews all giving her the opportunity to complain about the many forces that joined together to deny her her rightful place as queen i might feel a bit just a bit of sympathy for the woman if not for her greatest crimethere was a country called libya it had the highest standard of living in all of africa its people had not only free education and health care but all kinds of other benefits that other africans could only dream about it was also a secular state a quality to be cherished in africa and the middle east but moammar gaddafi of libya was never a properly obedient client of washington amongst other shortcomings the man threatened to replace the us dollar with gold for payment of oil transactions create a common african currency and was a strong supporter of the palestinians and foe of israelin 2011 secretary of state hillary clinton was the prime moving force behind the united states and nato turning libya into a failed state where it remains todaythe attack against libya was one that the new york times said clinton had championed  convincing president obama in what was arguably her moment of greatest influence as secretary of state the people of libya were bombed almost daily for more than six months the main excuse given was that gaddafi was about to invade benghazi the libyan center of his opponents and so the united states and nato were thus saving the people of that city from a massacre the american people and the american media of course swallowed this story though no convincing evidence of the alleged impending massacre has ever been presented the nearest thing to an official us government account of the matter a congressional research service report on events in libya for the period makes no mention at all of the threatened massacrethe usnato heavy bombing sent libya crashing in utter chaos leading to the widespread dispersal throughout north african and middle east hotspots of the gigantic arsenal of weaponry that gaddafi had accumulated libya is now a haven for terrorists from al qaeda to isis whereas gaddafi had been a leading foe of terrorists he had declared libya as a barrier to terrorists as well as african refugees going to europe the bombing has contributed greatly to the area s mammoth refugee crisisand when hillary was shown a video about the horrific murder of gaddafi by his opponents she loudly cackled yes that s the word we came we saw he died you can see it on youtubethere s also her support of placing regime change in syria ahead of supporting the syrian government in its struggle against isis and other terrorist groups even more disastrous was the 2003 us invasion of iraq which she as a senator supportedif all this is not sufficient to capture the utter charm of the woman another foreignpolicy adventure one which her swooning followers totally ignore the few that even know about it is the coup ousting the moderately progressive manuel zelaya of honduras in june 2009 a tale told many times in latin america the downtrodden masses finally put into power a leader committed to reversing the status quo determined to try to put an end to two centuries of oppression and before long the military overthrows the democraticallyelected government while the united states if not the mastermind behind the coup does nothing to prevent it or to punish the coup regime as only the united states can punish meanwhile washington officials pretend to be very upset over this affront to democracy district of columbiahow many people around the world know that in washington dc district of columbia where i live the capital city of the united states  the country that is always lecturing the world about this thing called democracy  the citizens do not have the final say over making the laws that determine life in their city many americans as well are not aware of thisaccording to the us constitution section 8 congress has the final say and in recent years has blocked the city from using local tax dollars to subsidize abortion for lowincome women blocked the implementation of legal marijuana use blocked needle exchanges blocked certain taxes blocked a law that says employers cannot discriminate against workers based on their reproductive decisions imposed private schools into the publicschool system and will soon probably block the district s new assistedsuicide law already blocked in the house of representatives on top of all this since dc is not a state its citizens do not have any representatives in the senate and their sole representative in the house has

MSM Fake News: How Washington Post Sexed-up its ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,this is a story about how once trusted mainstream media outlets like washington post and the new york times have used their vast platforms to distort reality and spread disinformation en masse to both the american and global public it s also a story about a new excuse industry which has sprung up to medicate hillary clinton s tragic defeatthe article below written by awardwinning journalist robert parry reveals the shocking extent to which the establishment is willing to go to achieve both domestic political and international geopolitical outcomesin september we were told by multiple us mainstream media that suspected russian operators used facebook and twitter accounts to spread anticlinton messages which somehow affected the electoral outcome in 2016 this was followed by a dramatic announcement by facebook officials that they had responded to the crisis by shutting down several hundred accounts approx 470 suspected to have been created by a firm linked to the kremlin who used russian bot accounts to purchase 100000 worth of facebook post ads 3000 ads in total over a 3 year period that s only 33000 per year which we re told were pushing divisive issues during and after the american election campaign so said the new york timesas it turns out the story was not only wildly exaggerated it provided a convenient smoke screen to coverup another case of real collusionthe scale of american propaganda is simply breathtakingin this single passage taken from the recent new york times scoop on the alleged facebook russian bot phenomenon you can see the full compliment of packaged lies which has become a set piece in us mainstream discourse now the russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of democratic emails or the fire hose of stories true false and in between that battered mrs clinton on russian outlets like rt and sputnik far less splashy and far more difficult to trace was russia s experimentation on facebook and twitter the american companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and in this case did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda it gets worse though what the washington post and others like the new york times have obscured from the american people through this massive propaganda exercise is the obama administration and partisan democrats own role in helping to generate this contrived conspiracy or fake news in the absence of any actual evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia what we have now is a case of silicon valley giant facebook actually colluding with the white house and the federal government officials in order to help fabricate a highly politicized false conviction here are some of the main points in the article below powerful politicians pressured facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling the washington post and others tried to convince a naive portion of the public to believe that somehow 100000 in transient facebook ad impacted the tens of billions of dollars spent during us political spending for the 2016 election cycle with all of the hype about russian operatives the mainstream media has not produced evidence to show who bought the adsas journalistic hoaxes go this is one of the biggest we ve seenperhaps an even bigger fraud in all of this however is how a corporate mainstream media outlet like the washington post can use it s unlimited resources and media might to push out a blatantly fake narrative intentionally distorted to deceive the public in order to achieve some partisan political objective and then site on the board of the establishment s first draft project which they claim is leading the fight against fake news  how can a major purveyor of fake news be left to lead the fight to tackle fake news  this is the danger of allowing an establishment cartel comprising of the corporate media facebook google and other tech monopolies to devise their own information policing regimemore on this incredible story from awardwinning consortium news here   by robert parrysome people are calling the antirussian hysteria being whipped up across the us mainstream news media a new golden age of american journalism although it looks to me more like a new age of yellow journalism prepping the people for more military spending more information warfare and more actual waryes without doubt president trump is a boorish and dangerous demagogue now highlighted by his reckless speech before the united nations last week his schoolyard tweet taunts toward north korean leader kim jong un and his ugly denunciation of black athletes for protesting against police killings of often unarmed africanamericansand yes i know that some people feel that the evidencelite andor false allegations about russian meddling are the golden ticket to trump s impeachment but the unprofessional behavior of the new york times the washington post and pretty much the entire mainstream media regarding russiagate cannot be properly justified by the goal of removing trump from officeethically in journalism the ends however much you might wish them to succeed cannot justify the means if those means involve violating rules of evidence and principles of fairness journalism should be a place where all sides get a fair shake not where some get a bum s rushbut the us mainstream media has clearly joined the antitrump resistance and hates russian president vladimir putin too so we are given such travesties of journalism as appeared as a banner headline across the front page of monday s washington post another screed about how russia supposedly used facebook ads to flip last november s election for trumpthe article purports to give the inside story of how facebook belatedly came to grips with how the company s social network played a key role in the us election but actually it is a story about how powerful politicians bullied facebook into coming up with something anything to support the narrative of russian meddling including direct interventions by president obama and sen mark warner of virginia the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee and a key legislator regarding regulation of hightech industriesfinding the evidence in other words facebook was sent back again and again to find what obama and warner wanted the social media company to find eventually facebook turned up 100000 in ads from 2015 into 2017 that supposedly were traced somehow to russia these ads apparently addressed political issues in america although facebook has said most did not pertain directly to the presidential election and some ads were purchased after the electionleft out of the post s latest opus is what a very small pebble these ads were even assuming that russians did toss the 100000 or so in ad buys into the very large lake of billions of dollars in us political spending for the 2016 election cycle it also amounts to a miniscule fraction of facebook s 27 billion in annual revenueso the assertion that this alleged meddling and we ve yet to see any evidence connecting these ads to the russian government played a key role in the us election is both silly and outrageous especially given the risks involved in stoking animosities between nucleararmed russia and nucleararmed americafacebook colluding with governmenteven the post s alarmist article briefly acknowledges that it is still unclear who bought the ads referring to the purchasers as suspected russian operatives in other words we don t even know that the 100000 in ads over three years came from russians seeking to influence the us election by comparison many facebook advertisers even some small businesses spend 100000 per day on their ads not 100000 over three yearsbut this diminutive effort by suspected russian operatives doesn t stop the post from going on and on about fake news and disinformation albeit again without offering evidence or specifics of any russian fake news or disinformation it has simply become official washington s new groupthink to say that everything linked to russia or its international tv network rt is fake news or disinformation even though examples are lacking or often turn out to be false accusations themselvesfor instance there is nothing in the post s article acknowledging that nothing from the various democratic email disclosures which have been blamed on russia again without real evidence has been identified as untrue so how can truthful information whether you like how it was obtained or not be fake news or disinformation falsehood as factbut monday s post expos simply asserts the claim as flat fact or as the article asserts what russian operatives posted on facebook was for the most part indistinguishable from legitimate political speech the difference was the accounts that were set up to spread the misinformation and hate were illegitimate in responsible journalism such an accusation would be followed by a forinstance giving an example of the misinformation and hate that the russian operatives note how they have been magically transformed from suspected russian operatives to simply russian operatives were disseminatingbut there is no example of the russian misinformation and hate a classic violation of the reporting principle of show don t tell in this story it s all tell and no showindeed what is shown in the article is often contradictory to the story s conclusion the article says for instance a review by the company found that most of the groups behind the problematic pages had clear financial motives which suggested that they weren t working for a foreign government but amid the mass of data the company was analyzing the security team did not find clear evidence of russian disinformation or ad purchases by russianlinked accounts so facebook initially after extensive searching did not find evidence of a russian operation then after continued pressure from highlevel democrats facebook continued to scour its system and again found nothing or as the post article acknowledged facebook had searched extensively for evidence of foreign purchases of political advertising but had come up short that prompted warner to fly out to silicon valley to personally press facebook executives to come up with the evidence to support the democrats theory about russia paying for carefully targeted anticlinton ads in key districtsthe post s article reported that finally facebook chief security officer alex stamos appealed to warner for help if us intelligence agencies had any information about the russian operation or the troll farms it used to disseminate misinformation they should share it with facebook the company is still waiting people involved in the matter said under pressurestill faced with extraordinary pressure from senior democrats facebook finally delivered the desired results or as the post reported by early august facebook had identified more than 3000 ads addressing social and political issues that ran in the united states between 2015 and 2017 and that appear to have come from accounts associated with the st petersburg russiabased internet research agency so the ads covering three years including postelection 2017 only appear to be associated with some private russian operation that only allegedly has ties to the kremlin and the total sums of the ad buys are infinitesimal compared to what it actually takes to have any real impact on facebook or in a us presidential electionif the context of this story were changed slightly say it was about the us government trying to influence public opinion in another country which actually does happen quite a bit the post would be among the first news outlets to laugh off such allegations or dismiss the vague accusations as a conspiracy theory but since these allegations fit with the prejudices of the post s editors an entirely different set of journalistic standards is appliedwhat the article also ignores is the extraordinary degree of coercion that such highlevel political pressure can put on a company that recognizes its vulnerability to government regulationas facebook has acknowledged in corporate filings action by governments to restrict access to facebook in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook in their country restrict access to facebook from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of facebook in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely in the event that access to facebook is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected avoiding realityin other words another way to have framed this story is that powerful politicians who could severely harm facebook s business model were getting in the face of facebook executives and essentially demanding that they come up with something to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling the democratic leaders wanted this finding as an explanation for hillary clinton s image left stunning defeat rather than going through the painful process of examining why the party has steadily lost ground in white workingclass areas across the countrywhat is missed in these russiabashing articles is that the democratic brand has been sinking for years including massive losses in statehouses across the country as well as in congress the party s decline was not a oneoff event with donald trump suddenly snaking away with significant parts of the white working class because the russians bought some facebook adshowever instead of looking in the mirror national democrats demanded that facebook executives ferret out whatever tiny or imaginary information there might be about some russians buying facebook ads and then allow those coerced findings to be fed into the excuse industry for why hillary clinton lostand what about the post s repeated accusations about russia engaging in disinformation and fake news without offering a single example apparently these assertions have become such articles of faith in the us mainstream media that they don t require any proofhowever honest journalism demands examples and evidence not just vague accusations the reality is that the us government has stumbled again and again when seeking to paint rt as a disinformation outlet or a vehicle for undermining american democracyfor instance the jan 6 report on alleged russian cyber operations released by obama s director of national intelligence james clapper included a lengthy appendix dated from 2012 which decried rt for such offenses as allowing a debate among thirdparty presidential candidates who had been excluded from the republicandemocratic debates covering the occupy wall street protests and citing the environmental dangers from fracking the idea that american democracy is threatened by allowing thirdparty candidates or other american dissidents to have a voice is at best an upsidedown understanding of democracy and more likely an exercise in hypocritical propagandafalse accusationsanother misfired attempt to discredit rt came from obama s under secretary of state for public diplomacy richard stengel who issued a dipnote in april 2014 which helped establish the narrative of rt as a source of russian disinformationfor instance stengel claimed that rt reported a ludicrous assertion that the united states had spent 5 billion to produce ukraine s regime change in february 2014but what stengel a former managing editor of time magazine apparently failed to understand was that rt was referring to a public speech by assistant secretary of state for european affairs victoria nuland to us and ukrainian business leaders on dec 13 2013 in which she told them that we have invested more than 5 billion in what was needed for ukraine to achieve its european aspirations in other words the rt report wasn t ludicrous at allnuland also was a leading proponent of regime change in ukraine who personally cheered on the maidan demonstrators even passing out cookies in an intercepted precoup phone call with us ambassador to ukraine geoffrey pyatt nuland discussed who should run the new government and pondered with pyatt how to glue or midwife this thing so stengel was the one disseminating false information not rtsimilarly senior us politicians including hillary clinton and the us mainstream media have falsely asserted that all 17 us intelligence agencies signed off on the russiadidit hacking claimsfor months that canard was used to silence skepticism after all how could you question something that all 17 us intelligence agencies confirmed to be truebut it turned out that as dni clapper himself a hardline russiabasher belatedly acknowledged the jan 6 report on the alleged russian hacking was the work of handpicked analysts from only three agencies the cia fbi and nsa and the assessment itself admitted that it was not asserting the russian conclusion as fact only the analysts opinionthe new york times finally retracted its use of the fake claim about all 17 us intelligence agencies in late june 2017 although it wouldn t let the lie lie so instead the times made misleading references to a consensus among us intelligence agencies without using the number continue this story at consortium newsread more

Undercutting the Nation State? Chicago Group Suggests ‘Global Cities’ Should Run World Affairs,mark anderson truth houndchicago ill the disruptive forces changing cities program conducted by the chicago council of global affairs sept 15 was a textbook case of an elite organization pursuing a tightly planned dictatorial society while sounding like it s seeking a democratic promising vision of fairness and prosperity for allit s all being spearheaded in accordance with the growing global cities movement that gradually challenges the authority of the very nationstates that the world s primary cities inhabitthis approach according to several ccgaaligned think tanks journalists and others supporting the global parliament of mayors and similar groupings amounts to a direct challenge to national authority in order to usurp some of the key powers delegated to national governments by their charters and constitutionssince this movement chisels away at the constitutional foundations of nations it risks undermining them in a way that would redraw the lines of governance in a manner that s highly unpredictable and potentially radical and unlawful the policy areas over which cities want to assume much more influence and ultimately exert control include battling climate change regulating immigration in order to increase it while providing sanctuary cities along with sparking job growth and several other things even including the seemingly improbable realm of foreign policy where you d think mayors would not treadthe ccga s latest program sept 15 held ontherecord at the organization s conference center in the prudential building on randolph street was a continuation of many of the themes covered in early june 2016 and june 2017 at the ccga s annual allday forum on global cities the keynote speaker sept 15 was amy liu who s vice president and director of the metropolitan policy program at washington dc s brookings institutionshe s considered a national expert on cities and metropolitan areas adept at translating research and insights into action on the ground as director of brookings metro which liu cofounded in 1996 she pioneered the program s signature approach to policy and practice which uses rigorous research to inform strategies for economic growth and opportunity a ccga representative said while introducing liu in chicagoprior to her brookings work liu was special assistant to us housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros and staffed the us senate banking committee s subcommittee on housing and urban affairs she holds a northwestern university degree in social policy and urban studiesher remarks were promoted via the ccga website with statements like cities are increasingly driving the global economy but numerous disruptive forces    threaten to deepen inequality and economic exclusion unless cities adapt and evolve and while liu spoke of the choices that municipal leaders will need to make in order to give their workforces access to basic things like skills and to foster innovation and entrepreneurship while deepening regional connections  the key to understanding her message is discerning what she and the ccga mean by global forces of disruption to address such matters liu spoke solo and then collaborated with ccga moderator niamh king who prior to joining the ccga worked for the european commission and the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia among several other postsliu began her talk by saying she wants cities to be vibrant places to work and live but due to america s current national discourse under president trump we are turning our backs on climate change on the poor and the working class while also betraying our values as a nation of immigrants moreover people of all races and religions are being neglected under this national discourse so rather than take us backwards the nation needs our cities to move us forward liu carefully stated presenting a thinlyveiled claim that the nationstate especially a more nationalist one represents a barrier to what internationalistoriented cities can dothus the world s cities in essence need to run their nations she implied accordingly she called for a future that s hyperglobal more digital more urban more multiracial and multiethnic but her concern is that these very same forces of progress can also be great sources of division technology for example creates opportunities for some but destroys it for others favoring the highlyskilled while abandoning those who cannot keep paceto combat such disparities liu stressed that local leaders need to build inclusive local and regional economies that radically adapt to disruption and futureproof our cities citing her brookings work she said cities therefore should pursue three goals growth prosperity and inclusion that she added means quality growth of good jobs to seek better prosperity but to achieve this inclusion the benefits especially in terms of better incomes must accrue to all members of the community closing disparities by race and by place she also said that 63 us metro areas out of 100 experienced economic growth and job hikes between 2010 and 2015 according to brookings research but several cities only saw growth in lesserquality jobs while only eight made significant economic progress in inclusion for whites and people of color liu also stressed the nation s economic growth is not felt by most people    as a whole the bottom 50 of incomeearners the middle class the working class the poor have made no ground so the bulk of the nation s income gains have accrued to the top earners from this she concluded that it s up to the cities to bridge these gaps and solve the problemsliu then cited historic policies and attitudes that she feels have held us back in tackling such inequities accordingly at this point she delved into the disruptive forces facing cities and how city leaders can adapt to disruption doublespeak detectedironically liu spoke of these disruptive forces which are mainly macroeconomic in nature as if they re akin to the four horsemen of the apocalypse globalization urbanization technology and demographic change which she warned are upending existing systems she went on to say that while globalization has supposedly slowed down free trade is going strong accounting for 40 of world economic value trade she deduced from this has tremendous economic value because firms that export their wares hire more people and pay better wages than nonexporting firms yet while downplaying the immense damage free trade has wrought lest groupings like brookings and the ccga lose the narrative in their constant support for more freetrade treaties she admitted that us voters in the last election made it clear that globalization has left many without jobs for extended time periodsshowing a colorcoded map she also said that federal adjustment assistance has been extended to more than two million americans in the past two decades those whose jobs were terminated due to trade with 70 of such workers living in large and small metropolitan areas the trade pain was most felt in the industrial communities in the midwest and the south she also concededbending people to the system not vice versabut the crux of the matter shone through when she stated i would say that the problem isn t so much globalization but the failure of our public policies to help people and to help communities adjust to the new world order continue this article at the truth houndread more nwo news at 21st century

"Trump Bares Himself at UNGA, “In a Kind of Neocon Full Monte”", president trump speaking at the unga photo screenshotrobert parry consortium newsin discussing president trump there is always the soft prejudice of low expectations people praise him for reading from a teleprompter even if his words make little sense but there is no getting around the reality that his maiden address to the united nations general assembly must rank as one of the most embarrassing moments in america s relations with the global communitytrump offered a crude patchwork of propaganda and bluster partly delivered as a campaign speech praising his own leadership boasting about the relatively strong us economy that he mostly inherited from president obama and partly reflecting his continued subservience to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahuhowever perhaps most importantly trump s speech may have extinguished any flickering hope that his presidency might achieve some valuable course corrections in how the united states deals with the world ie shifting away from the disastrous warinterventionist policies of his two predecessorsbefore the speech there was at least some thinking that his visceral disdain for the neoconservatives who mostly opposed his nomination and election might lead him to a realization that their policies toward iran iraq syria and elsewhere were at the core of america s repeated and costly failures in recent decadesinstead apparently after a bracing lecture from netanyahu on monday trump bared himself in a kind of neocon full monte he repeated the israelineocon tripe about iran destabilizing the middle east when shiiteruled iran actually has helped stabilize iraq and syria against sunni terrorist groups and other militants supported by saudi arabia and to a degree israel he again denounced the iranian nuclear agreement whose main flaw in the eyes of the israelis and the neocons is that it disrupted their plans to bombbombbomb iran and he called for regime change in iran a long beloved dream of the israelis and the neocons he repeated the israelineocon propaganda about hezbollah as a terrorist organization when hezbollah s real crime was driving the israeli military out of southern lebanon in 2000 ending an israeli occupation that began with israel s 1982 invasion he praised his rushtojudgment decision to bomb syria last april in line with israelineocon propaganda against president bashar alassad and partly out of a desire to please the same washington establishment that is still scheming how to impeach him he spoke with the crass hypocrisy that the neocons and many israeli leaders have perfected particularly his demand that all nations respect the rights of every other sovereign nation when he made clear that he like his white house predecessors is ready to violate the sovereignty of other nations that get in official washington s waya litany of warsjust this century the united states has invaded multiple nations without un authorization based on various coalitions of the willing and other subterfuges for wars of aggression which the nuremberg tribunals deemed the supreme international crime and which the un was specifically created to preventnot only did president george w bush invade both afghanistan and iraq while also sponsoring antiterror operations in many other countries but president barack obama acknowledged ordering military attacks in seven countries including against the will of sovereign states such as libya and syria obama also supported a violent coup against the elected government of ukrainefor his part trump already has shown disdain for international law by authorizing military strikes inside yemen and syria in other words if not for the fear of provoking american anger many of the world s diplomats might have responded with a barrage of catcalls toward trump for his blatant hypocrisy without doubt the united states is the preeminent violator of sovereignty and international law in the world today yet trump wagged his finger at others including russia over ukraine and china over the south china seahe declared we must reject threats to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow then with a seeming blindness to how much of the world sees the united states as a law onto itself trump added the scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based of course in the us mainstream media s commentary that followed trump s hypocrisy went undetected that s because across the american politicalmedia establishment the us right to act violently around the world is simply accepted as the way things are supposed to be international law is for the other guy not for the indispensible nation not for the sole remaining superpower on bibi s leashdespite some of his america first rhetoric tossed in as red meat to his base trump revealed a global outlook that differed from the bushobama neoconservativeliberalinterventionist approach in words only in substance trump appears to be just the latest american poodle on bibi netanyahu s leashfor instance trump bragged about attacking syria over a dubious chemicalweapons claim while ignoring the role of the saudiisraeli tandem in assisting al qaeda and its syrian affiliate trump threatened the international nuclear agreement with iran while calling for regime change in tehran two of netanyahu s top priorities and trump warned that he would totally destroy north korea over its nuclear and missile programs while making no mention of israel s rogue nuclear arsenal and sophisticated delivery capabilitiesignoring saudi arabia s ties to terrorism trump touted his ludicrous summit in riyadh in which he danced with swords and let king salman and other corrupt persian gulf monarchs who have long winked and nodded at ideological and logistical support going to al qaeda and other islamic terror groups pretend their governments were joining an antiterror coalitionexploding the myth that he is at least a streetsmart operator who can t be easily conned trump added in saudi arabia early last year i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 arab and muslim nations we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires them no wonder netanyahu seemed so pleased with trump s speech the israeli prime minister could have written it himself while allowing trump to add a few crude flourishes like calling north korean leader kim jong un rocket man on a suicide mission  referring to the loser terrorists  and declaring that many parts of the world are going to hell trump also tossed in a plug for his new strategy for victory in afghanistan and threw in some interventionist talk regarding the western hemisphere with more threats to cuba and venezuela about escalating sanctions and other activities to achieve more regime change solutionsso what trump made clear in his un address is that his america first and prosovereignty rhetoric is simply cover for a set of policies that are indistinguishable from those pushed by the neocons of the bush administration or the liberal interventionists of the obama administration the rationalizations may change but the endless wars and regime change machinations continue watch trump s full speech here  read more trump news at 21st century wire trump

What a Wonderful World – US Saviour Complex,bruno guigue 21st century wirepurveyor of platitudes the west portrays itself as the epitome of universal values  a paragon of democracy this champion of human rights always deploys its presumed virtues in support of its hegemonic ambitions like the fairy godmother doing her best to match her morals with her interests she veils her ambitions with the cloak of law and justice thus the free world goes about bombing foreign nations for the sake of democracy  preferably in oil or mineralrich territories by combining a simple creed with capitalist greed it is acting as if it can convert its economic supremacy into moral privilegethe rest of the world is not fooled by these tactics but who cares the free world is always right because it represents the good fight and for as long as it is the most powerful it will not be contradicted the inherent barbarism that it projects onto others is the counter to its selfproclaimed monopoly on civilization sanctified by the holy order of right to intervene  a marriage of the gi sandbags with the kouchnerstyle bag of rice the west vassalized by washington believes wholeheartedly that they can save the world by subjugating it to the pitiless ravages demanded by the financial vultures and military industrial complexthis supremacist enterprise was not born yesterday it was midwived in the historical period dear to fernand braudel that of the emergence of the world economy driven by its superior technological advances since the renaissance the western world has propelled itself towards the conquest of our planet earth patiently the west has appropriated other cultures other worlds and twisted them into its own image enforcing obeissance and imitation eliminating all those who would not conform its certitude is untroubled by its own hypocrisy the west perceives itself as a metaphor for this world the west wanted to expand from being a part of the world into being the whole in the same way today we see countries comprising 10 of the world s population portraying themselves as the international community over the last three centuries colonial conquest has demonstrated the west s desire to expand its influence beyond its own boundaries under the banner of bringing civilization to the underdeveloped this global domination project was temporarily derailed by the uprising of the colonized peoples in the 20th century but it made a triumphant return with its north american branch of hegemonyamerica the far west discovered by christopher columbus in search of the far east  inherited the old continent penchant for imperialism and rapacious carpetbaggery the us converted its lack of history into the promise of a better future  emerging suddenly from anglosaxon puritanism the us magnified the globalist for profit ethos paid for with the blood of the americanindian genocide america was born the newly minted metaphor for the worldit is not certain that this change was for the better colonial empires collapsed under the weight of their archaic structures while us hegemony maintains itself through modern technology channels from google to drone warfare suddenly the us was the most supple and resilient what imbues it with flexibility also ensures its longevity from the white pith helmet of the european colonial overlords to the digital screens of us cyber warfare a revolution took place the us substituted a shockcolonization dismantled after bloody decolonization conflict with a multifaceted hegemonic enterprise taking over from the classic colonial three m s

midwesterners the american empire is projecting its devastating manichaeism upon the rest of the world dreaming with its eyes wide open the us envisages a definitive alliance between good and evil the indestructible pillar upon which to build a straightforward ethnocentrism the law is on their side as it embodies the core values of democracy human rights and market economy  obviously this is a crude ideology a fraudulent mask for its own sordid interests but it is effective its efficacy is proven by the popular consensus that the us won the second world war capitalism works cuba is a tropical gulag assad is worse than hitler and that north korea is a threat to the world this process of selfbeatification bestows upon the northamericanempire zealots the right to track down all evil in the world no scruples will impede its saviour frenzy it is the very incarnation of such an exceptional civilization  that it must cleanse the world of barbarism by all means at its disposal that is why modern imperialism functions as a court of universal law a judge that rewards or punishes where it sees fit before this elevated moral jurisdiction the cia represents the prosecution the pentagon is the secular chamber the us president is the high court judge a deus ex machina  invoking divine justice the lightning strike upon the axis of evil and any other sinners circulating in the court of the empire of good this tendency for the us to see itself as the moral compass for the world is central to this structure and is unperturbed by the rapid turnaround of presidents in the white house a

Jimmy Carter: ‘Koreans Want Peace Treaty to Replace 1953 Ceasefire’,21st century wire says reframing the current diplomatic crisis in north korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situationformer us president jimmy carter is suggesting just that but will the hawks in washington listen the carter centerthe harsh rhetoric from washington and pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the united states and north korea in addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric our leaders need to encourage talks between north korea and other countries especially china and russia the recent un security council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help in all cases a nuclear exchange must be avoided all parties must assure north koreans they we will forego any military action against them if north korea remains peacefulpresident jimmy carteri have visited north korea three times and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect usdprk relationsin june 1994 i met with kim il sung in a time of crisis when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the international atomic energy agency and to seek mutual agreement with the united states on a permanent peace treaty to have summit talks with the president of south korea to expedite the recovery of the remains of american service personnel buried in his country and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula kim il sung died shortly after my visit and his successor kim jong il notified me and leaders in washington that he would honor the promises made by his father these obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in geneva by robert gallucci and other representatives of the clinton administrationi returned to pyongyang in august 2010 at the invitation of north korean leaders to bring home aijalon gomes an american who had been detained there my last visit to north korea was in may 2011 when i led a delegation of elders former presidents of ireland and finland and former prime minister of norway to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy peopleduring all these visits the north koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the united states and their neighbors but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country they wanted a peace treaty especially with america to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the korean war in 1953 and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period they have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any american attack the influence of china in pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since kim jong un became the north korean leader in december 2011a commitment to peace by the united states and north korea is crucialwhen this confrontational crisis is ended the united states should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953 the united states should make this clear to north koreans and to our alliesread more north korea news at 21st century wire north korea filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,Middle-east,7-Sep-17,0
"Message for Progressive Left: ‘If You Want to See Real Nazis, Come to Ukraine’",ever since last month the us media and the left wing politicians have been up in arm about alleged rise of nazism in america by now the coverage has been incessant and beyond hysterical as pundits and antifascist activists claim that a viable white supremacist movement is threatening to take over the country which is a mediadriven alternative reality what america s mainstream media establishment will not mention is the us government s own role particularly that of the obama administration and hillary clinton s state department and funded by her campaign financier george soros in helping to fuel the scourge of nazism in eastern europe in the ukraine likewise republicans and socalled conservatives will not want to mention party luminary senator john mccain s own personal role in promoting ukraine s far right parties and helping shoehorn them into power in 2014 after a successful usbacked coup d etat and putsch and the disastrous junta which has followedthe following open letter was posted by aleksandr gontar from donetsk in eastern ukraine skillfully articulates the current farce in the united states and the feigned righteous indignation from the progressive left over the recent staged political altercation in charlottesville virginia i always considered myself as a person with leftwing views but looking at what is happening in the us i can t escape the thought that the american left in its majority is the dumbest and most useless comrade on the planet as a minimum to profess liberal views and at the same time to call oneself leftist is a bit sillythe desperate fight of american comrades against nazis in general is comical they are shocked by a torchlight procession in charlottesville while regular torch processions in the capital of ukraine which they so fervently support in its fight for democracy  don t shock them i speak as well about simple redblue rainbow plankton as well as about the famous fighters against oppression a la tom morello whom i respect as a musician and other celebrities cosplaying che guevara with a red star on the cap a nightmare nazis are in america they hoisted the colors of the confederates and shaved their heads oh my god  american nazis are the same clowns as american anti fascists  by the waykids come into the ukraine we will show you nazis real ones who kill people kill massively proceeding from the racial theory they kill in savage ways like the ss did in the 40 s we will show you a whole state that erects monuments to the ideologists and performers of the holocaust of jewish riots of the genocide of poles who sweep away monuments to the liberators of mankind from nazism a state with a nazi ministry of truth repressions against dissent promotion of racial hatred in schools on tv in children s books a state in which the ministry of internal affairs supervises a website that incites the committing of murder of unreliable citizens openly publishing all their personal information as well as members of their familiesso when you will have such things in america we will talk when you have instead of a car crashing into a crowd of antifascists these antifascists like cattle are herded into the local house of trade unions and will be burned with molotov cocktails finishing off with steel poles those who try to escape when the fbi creates a website on which it will publish the addresses of those who criticize trump and the white race and the organized altright will start to go to these addresses who after your murder will be called patriots and will be released so then we will believe in your whining about nazisand for now suck on it mr american antifasciststhis letter was originally published at stalker zone translated by ollie richardson and angelina siardread more alt right news at 21st century wire alt right filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,Middle-east,5-Sep-17,0
Trump Springs the Neocon Trap  Again: North Korea’s ‘Test’ is No Act of War,patrick henningsen 21st century wirehere we go again there seems to be no end to the escalation of tensions between north korea and the united states and its alliesyesterday pyongyang s state broadcaster came out declaring what it claims is another successful test  this time with a hydrogen bomb which they say could be mounted on to their still as yet nonexistent intercontinental ballistic missile icbmseizing the moment state news anchor ri chun hee proudly announced that the test was a perfect success and symbolises the country s final step on the long road to attaining a state nuclear force all very excitingstill there has been no independent verification of the claim but why let that get in the way of a promising international security crisis kim jung un looking at shiny objects pointing generally looking busy north korea s alleged test is said to have happened just hours after pyongyang staterun media released images of leader kim jong un inspecting looking pointing something which looks like it could be a hydrogen bomb but no one is really surewe re also told that this was ready to be placed on top of an icbm however no one has actually seen a real operational icbm yet that s kind of an important detail in this grand plot but one which is routinely overlooked by legions of western mainstream experts on cnn and nbc so far the dprk only has a series of botched tests of their shortrange hwasong12 rockets glorified scud missiles to show the world still the western media insist that this constitutes a potential threat to the usso confident was this mainstream media outlet that they ve seemed to have hedged their bets on the authenticity of the dprk state claims leaving the offending h bomb in quotes see also north korea and the unintended consequences of trumpthis wouldn t be the first time north korea exaggerated its wmd credentials last january they exaggerated claims of a successful hbomb test despite their dodgy record the western media and politicians who are fed by defense contracts are lapping up pyongyang s latest pig s breakfastwhatever this latest test was it s hardly an act of war meanwhile south korea wasted no time retaliating by showing off its new toys purchased out of its us dollar reserve account launching multiple missiles for the cameras seoul insists that it s ready to activate four terminal high altitude area defense thaad missile batteries it also carried out a major joint drill likely preplanned anyway with f15k fighter jets and surfacetosurface ballistic missiles this posturing by south korea has excited the western media to no end everyone is loving it because nothing brings eye balls and ratings like a good crisisguardian reporter justin mccurry confirms south korea has carried out a simulated attack on north korea s nuclear test site in a huge show of force in response to pyongyang s detonation of what it claims is a hydrogen bombseoul has also approved the complete deployment of a us antimissile system in another sign that it intends to address north korean provocations with reminders of its own military firepower while keeping the door open to dialogue you can be certain that cnn absolutely loves this latest crisis too wailing this morning south korea strengthened the deployment of a controversial usmade missile defense system and launched a huge show of military might on monday in response to north korea s hydrogen bomb test naturally not a word of condemnation from the western media about south korea s real provocations broadcast in colour around the worldhow serious is the threatat the time of publishing this piece members of the un security council are already convening emergency sessions about what to do next in the final analysis there will have to be some clear and present threat in order to justify some harsh response from the unsccan such a rational evaluation be made with so much theatre on both sideswashington s un ambassador nikki haley gave a predictable hawkish speech claiming that he is begging for war of course haley is all too eager to obligeonce again western media outlets are treating claims by north korea s staterun kcna media agency as good as gold ratings gold that isfor the us this latest move by north korea has been pr gold it s helped to revive and reenergize the dying conversation of a nuclear standoff between the good guys and the bad guys and to deal with those bad guys you need tough guysenter us treasury secretary steven mnuchin who swiftly moved in with tough new sanctions against the dprk warning that this isn t the time for just talk a novel approacheager to win back some approval points and stop the political hemorrhaging that seems to be draining all of the mojo trump had when he whippedup the campaign trail crowds promising to drain the swamp the president took to twitter to do what he thinks his base

to slam the door shut on any chance of bilateral negotiationssouth korea is finding as i have told them that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work they only understand one thing donald j trump realdonaldtrump september 3 2017toughestof course trump s comments appear to be winding up pyongyang a vicious circle of fighting talk are there any adults left in the roomnot to be outdone here comes a good cop enter us defense secretary james mad dog mattis who is still earning his nickname meant to resemble an unstable rabid house pet after his meeting with president trump and vice president mike pence on sunday the mad dog wearing a purple tie the same colour as hillary s revolution read his military decree on the white house lawn we have many military options and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them we made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies south korea and japan from any attack and our commitments among the allies are ironclad said mattiswhat a relief he sounds moderate compared to trump but wait before exiting the podium he said we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country namely north korea but as i said we have many options to do so this is a unique breed of lunatictalking tough and talking of options for annihilating a country normal people would say this is an idiotic proposition because the fallout would be much worse than any of kim apocalyptic sabre rattling all this looks very familiar quite simply what we are seeing here in washington is neoconservativism reasserting itself through one of its flagship planks the preemptive strike above all other military strategies this is always the most favorable for the pentagon because it doesn t require any real justification or accountability for a preemptive action all that s required is a sufficient amount of media fearmongering and political hype about the threat we all face and how we must act and then simply fire away and sift through the rubble reforming the narrative afterwards in the meantime the ruling parties can call it a success and claim that many lives were saved by this valiant action etc it s clean and straightforward albeit in the short term but extremely messy in the long termas much as hawks in washington would love to test out their new toys right now a conflagration is not likely to happen by the hand of the us in the pacific rim there are too many powerful players in the immediate vicinity south korea japan china taiwan philippines and russia too and the fallout from any rash usled geopolitical pissing contest surgical or kinetic action could be detrimental to all parties better to get someone else to start it for them but that s not easy eitherthere was a time when people had high hopes for mattis he was affectionately referred to as the warrior monk with many fox news pundits drooling over his apparent sun tzu prowess as was rumoured that he has actually read some historical books and was really smart and really wise apparently a rarity in washington military circles these days but no matter how many books people think he s read about the peloponnesian wars it s should be pretty clear by now that mattis like his predecessor ash carter is acting as kind of an executive sales rep for the military industrial complex that s essentially what the position of defense secretary has become in america it s a straightforward deal you ll keep your job as long as you do and say what s required to keep international tensions high at all times this translates into profits and shareholder dividends for industry stakeholders if you re not with the program then you ll have to tender your resignation just ask chuck hagelwhat americans should really understand is that the generals with whom trump is so enamored and who he trusts with all our bombs and silos have left nothing but a string of military failures in their wake between generals james mattis and major general hr mcmaster you have a collective 30 plus years and two of the worst military and foreign policy boondoggles in us history afghanistan and iraq underscored by successive failed surges add to these a total defeat in syria blowing billions of us taxpayer dollars on a proxy war that s arguably created a new generation of islamist extremists although no one will admit it impressive isn t it so why do the media continue to elevate the military brass not every general is a good general as with any other position or profession some are good and some are corrupt and many are incompetent or promoted for playing ball general david petraeus is a good example of this the media can t get enough of him he was the architect of the surge we re told which means he was around when obamabush ordered up another 30000 troops for iraq in a futile effort to fix what they broke still the media will bend over backwards in an almost worshipful mode whenever his name is mentioned forgetting that petraeus was found guilty of the same crime for which half of america wanted hillary clinton lockedup despite bringing his name and his office into disrepute petraeus was rewarded board positions with mega wall street firms like kkr and a perennial seat at bilderbergmen like mattis mcmaster and petraeus can and will run rings around this president who has already signaled his weakness for those chevrons on the shoulder andthis president will happily defer everything to these men should we be surprised if they keep getting it wronglet s just pray that they don t get it wrong with north korea

"SYRIA, NORTH KOREA: Trump’s “Axis of Evil” is Bigger and Better than the George Bush Version",whitney webb mint pressbush s axis of evil speech in 2002 was precursor to disastrous invasion and regime change now once again under trump that narrative has reemerged this time linking syria with north korea based on allegations by unidentified parties regarding chemical weapons shipmentson monday reuters published a widely circulated story based on a confidential united nations report on north korean sanctions violations according to the report which is not available to the general public two north korean shipments to a syrian government agency responsible for the country s chemical weapons program had been interceptedthe report according to reuters was authored by a panel of independent un experts and investigates alleged dealings between a north korean company and syria s scientific studies and research center ssrc a government agency that oversaw the nation s chemical weapons program before the internationallyrecognized destruction of that program took place in 2013notably the 37page document at no point gives details on when or where the interdictions occurred or details regarding what the shipments actually containedthe report further states that its account of the incident s occurrence is dependent on the testimony of two unidentified member states which interdicted shipments destined for syria and had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a komid contract with syria komid is the korea mining development trading corporation a pyongyangbased company the un had previously cited in 2009 when the un security council had it blacklisted for its role in supporting north korea s ballistic missile program as a primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons north korea is caught sending chemical weapons to syria amid concerns kim jongun and assad are working together httpstcoectij2jwn9 daily mail us dailymail august 22 2017north korea chemical weapons said intercepted en route to syria httpstcowdjzolgg8k via timesofisrael northkorea syria gregory smith gsmittysmith august 22 2017with their identities concealed there is no way of knowing if these member states are among the countries that have actively been pushing for the removal of syria s democraticallyelected president bashar alassad since the syrian conflict began in 2011 in addition another member state a nation not involved in the seizure of the shipments had informed the panel that it had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a komid contract with syria it appears that the statement made by this member state s representative was given by this ostensibly independent panel the same weight normally reserved for concrete evidenceit also remains unclear how the ssrc was determined to be the recipient of the intercepted shipments as the report simply states that the consignees were syrian entities designated by the european union and the united states as front companies for the ssrc with only reuters permitted access to this confidential report there is no way to know who or what these entities are as reuters left them unnamed in its articlefurthermore the composition of the un panel itself is also unknown though reuters stated that the panel was composed of independent experts reuters has also previously claimed that organizations such as the syrian observatory for human rights sohr were objective in the syrian conflict even though the sole person behind the group is rabidly antiassad prowestern intervention and reporting on syria from britain shielding the names of these independent experts from the public does little to lend credibility to the findings of this un reportthe north koreasyria arms connection narrativethe north koreasyria arms trade connection is not new this narrative first emerged earlier this year in april when the syrian government stood accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in idlib an event that was later roundly debunked by independent experts including professor emeritus at the massachusetts institute of technology mit and former scientist with the us department of defense theodore postolat the time several us publications including usa today and defense one backed up their claims of sinister cooperation between the syrian and north korean governments by citing professor bruce bechtol of angelo state university texas both outlets described bechtol as a north korea expert but bechtol s evidence cited in these reports such as when he asserts that i would be stunned i would be surprised if the nerve agent allegedly used by the assad regime on april 4 in the idlib province was not supplied by north korea amounts to conjecture bechtol who once worked for the defense intelligence agency and has longstanding links to the pentagon had previously authored a 2015 research paperon the north korea and syrian partnership in which he drew heavily on the cia for his sweeping assertions regarding the two nations alleged long history of collaboration in the production and development of chemical weaponsbechtol s conclusions are undermined by data from the stockholm international peace research institute sipri a recognized authority on the global weapons trade shows that syria has ordered weapons from north korea only three times since 1990 twice in 1990 and once in 1996 in other words syria according to sipri has not made any purchases from north korea in over 20 yearsgiven that arms deals with north korea s government were legal until 2006 and deals with komid were legal until 2009 if the partnership was really so longstanding and prolific why were there so few transactions between them in the years prior the established facts hardly fit the picture of a supposedly booming north koreasyria arms tradecreating the new axis of evil ultimately the attempts to link north korea to syria s defunct chemical weapons program are meant to create a new axis of evil by associating one evil dictator with another the axis of evil narrative first coined by george w bush in 2002 has been central to the us demonization of rogue governments that fail to submit to the usdominated global order of which the united nations is part this narrative has often been followed by the evil dictator label as it was with iraq and libya two of the countries comprising the original axis of evil under trump the axis of evil is having a resurgence a development that even mainstream media outlets like cnn have noted

AFGHANISTAN: Trump Surges Into the Graveyard of Empires, by ramping up us troop levels in afghanistan trump is alienating many supporters photo dodusaf tech sgt brigitte n brantley source wikicommonsmiles elliot 21st century wireon monday night us president donald trump made a speech in which he outlined his longawaited new strategy for the war in afghanistan as predicted by 21wire in july trump will undertake a fourth us surge in afghanistan building up us troop levels in the country just like bush and obama did before himhowever to say that he outlined a new strategy in his speech is being very kind to trump he did very little outlining and what he did present does not exactly qualify as new or as a strategyone of the most notable features of his speech was his refusal to disclose troop numbers or timescales for their deployment granted publicising those aspects of the us presence in afghanistan did not create a win for obama the former president promised to pull out all the troops by 2014 but left office in january 2017 with over 8500 us military personnel still stationed in the country for trump to keep such details from the american public particularly the troop numbers goes against basic democratic principles of transparency and accountability as finian cunningham says america s overseas wars are not just expanding under trump they are going secret and unaccountable furthermore simply sending more troops and beefing up military deployments to afghanistan is not a new strategy george w bush deployed a quiet surge to afghanistan in 2008 and obama presided over two separate surges in early and late 2009 none of which won the war see 21wire s recent article which points out fundamental flaws and problems with the us strategy and modus operandi in afghanistan doubling down on these flaws with more personnel money and weapons may only amplify themthe war was probably unwinnable from the outset anyway there is a reason afghanistan is referred to as the graveyard of empires justin raimondo s latest article responding to trump s announcement alludes to it so i studied afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle trump claims really did he study it enough to realize that no one has ever conquered afghanistan did he contemplate the storied history of that unforgiving land which caused even alexander the great to turn back or for a more lighthearted approach the following tweet plays on the seeming endlessness of the afghan war in american political lifei made this political cartoon in 2010 enjoy httpstcofsosagurcw pictwittercomjyfqizofzy matt bors mattbors august 22 2017another interesting feature of trump s speech was its focus on pakistan which he sharply criticized for harboring terrorists and allowing them safe havens  however as michael krieger points out in his excellent analysis guess which country he didn t mention the greatest sponsor of islamic radicalization the world has ever seen saudi arabia this once again proves that trump represents the same old tired thinking that s been running the us economy and society into the ground for decades this is now a 100 establishment presidency which will be completely defined by establishment thinking in other words imperial collapse is coming it seems an obvious point that talking about combating terrorism without addressing its primary causes and sources of support is somewhat foolish however it appears that trump and his administration need a reminderby far the most striking aspect of trump s announcement however is that it represents a 180 uturn totally reversing the attitude he had to us involvement in afghanistan since before he even began campaigning to become president the following is just one of many tweets dating back quite a few years in which trump complains about the us being in afghanistanwhen will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding afghanistan we must rebuild our country first donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 7 2011trump s announcement is already alienating much of his political base especially supporters who wanted him to prioritize american jobs and infrastructure over globalist projects such as trade deals and foreign wars more than that it is unlikely to be popular with the overall us electorate who are on the whole opposed to continuing the war on the other hand it is no surprise that the announcement is gaining praise from neocons and lawmakers such as sen john mccain raz sen mitch mcconnell rky and house speaker paul ryan rwidoes it even need to be said that the us has had troops deployed to afghanistan for 16 years this might make afghanistan one of the only truly intergenerational wars the us has foughtmet a man today who served in afghanistan 16 yrs ago now says his son serves there let that sink in as you support perpetual war brian j karem briankarem august 22 2017there is of course a question as to how much of this plan is coming from trump himself as opposed to from his advisers deep state handlers or other influences as finian cunningham argues below there is reason to believe that trump has been compromised by the deep state  many even believe that soft coup has occurred and that trump is no longer really in charge yet others question whether trump had any authenticity to begin with on the left especially some people perceive trump to be thoroughly dishonest and merely a representative of robberbaron capitalist fascism these issues are part of the larger question of trump s authenticity but unfortunately we can t provide those answers here whatever one s position on this however none of the possible options lets the president off the hook in all cases he is the man responsible it s his name on the door and it is his responsibility to either make good on his promises to the american people or at the very least to keep them informed in light of his announcement on afghanistan neither one appears to be happeningsee also afghanistan forgotten but not gonemore on this from rt us army soldiers in afghanistan the country has been called the graveyard of empires for being notoriously hard to conquer photo us army source wikicommonsfinian cunningham rtif one moment stands out as the clearest signal yet of us president trump turning his back on supporters it was his announcement this week to reescalate american military intervention in afghanistanhis signature campaign promise of putting america first and ending the folly of overseas wars launched by previous administrations was shredded on prime time television when he gave orders for thousands of more us troops to be sent to afghanistan the already 16year war in that country america s longest will now go on indefinitely longerthe huffington post headlined trump s vague new afghanistan strategy continues an endless war not only that but this president is refusing to give any public information on force numbers or timescale america s overseas wars are not just expanding under trump they are going secret and unaccountablethis surge in militarism is precisely what candidate trump said he would not do when he campaigned for votes among bluecollar workers in the rust belt states vowing instead to channel us economic resources to revive forgotten communities at home recall his blustering inauguration speech on january 20 when he bemoaned the american carnage at home and abroadas the huffington post writes when obama was still in office and overseeing a massive troop presence in afghanistan trump repeatedly bashed the operation as a waste of money and called for a quick withdrawal from the country how s that for a uturn this is at a time when support among trump s voter base in the rust belt states has plummeted there is weakness in the heartland reported nbc because workers fear trump is reneging on past commitments to revitalize their livelihoods their concern is that this president is too interested in giving tax breaks to corporations and kowtowing to the pentagonironically donald trump likes to portray himself as an alphamale who is his own boss it is abundantly clear now that trump is a mere manikin who sits in the white house taking orders from his generalswhen trump ousted stephen bannon his staunchest ally in the white house it was under the orders of the military figures who are now dominant in his administration trump s chief of staff former marine general john kelly wanted bannon out because of his contrarian viewswhen bannon gave a surprise interview last week contradicting the militarist policy on north korea that was the last straw bannon said there was no military option in solving the north korea standoff which flew in the face of what the pentagon has been advising trump with all options on the table only days later he was kicked outbannon has now returned to edit breitbart news the nationalistic website which has in the past served as a media booster for trump following the announcement on afghanistan breitbart news declared trump reverses course and blasted his speech a flipflop as reported by politicobannon had been a vigorous counsel to trump against overseas militarism and in particular about afghanistan he is thought to have been the primary influence behind trump s economic nationalism of america firstit is no coincidence that trump decided to get rid of bannon while huddled with military generals and intelligence chiefs at camp david last weekend then three days after his departure from the white house trump delivers his uturn on reescalating the military involvement in south asia exactly as the pentagon top brass had been urgingwith little or no policy achievements so far trump is emerging as a blowhard who is all too willing to toe the line to survive even if that means stabbing his supposed allies in the back this is a president who has a big mouth and big ego and not much else all the promises to his voter base are being seen to be cruel hoaxes perpetrated by one who is always denouncing others over hoaxesthe rise of the generals in trump s administration alongside a weakkneed figurehead president should surely be cause for concern for its sinister constitutional implications but disturbingly the drift toward a military government in the us hardly causes a public ruffle indeed it is actually welcomed by prominent news mediain an editorial last weekend condemning the failing trump presidency the new york times seems to be oblivious in its endorsement of military control over the white houseit states one measure of the despair caused by mr trump s behavior is that we find ourselves strangely comforted by things that in any normal presidency would be cause for concern americans accustomed constitutionally and politically to civilian leadership now find themselves relying on three current and former generals john kelly the new white house chief of staff h r mcmaster the national security adviser and jim mattis the secretary of defense to stop mr trump from going completely off the rails last week too when the five joint chiefs of staff roundly rebuked trump over his ambiguous comments on racial violence the us media widely saw that intervention by the pentagon as a welcome disciplining of the presidentit s a sobering realitycheck on how the supposed radical populist president who promised to return governing power to the ordinary citizens is now firmly in the vice of a corporatemilitary caballook at trump s cabinet apart from the three generals kelly mcmaster and mattis the other key posts are run by an exoil ceo rex tillerson at the state department and former wall street executives steven mnuchin as treasury secretary gary cohn as national economic adviser and wilbur ross as commerce secretarythis combination of military and industrial corporatism at the executive level of government is a definition of a fascist state combine that with a malleable megalomaniac who is willing to betray his allies and voter base and that makes for a dangerous cabaltrump s readiness to go to war in venezuela north korea and iran and to give license to the pentagon to step up its air force slaughter in iraq syria and yemen are all signals of how far this presidency has degeneratedbut it is trump s brazen backtracking on afghanistan that most transparently shows his unscrupulous character and just how much the pentagon has taken control over this presidencylast november the american people voted for a radical change one that would deliver economic revival and jobs at home while implementing more peaceful foreign relationstoday americans have got the opposite of what they were calling for when they elected president trump the implications are blatant and disconcerting american democracy no longer exists if it ever did the will of the people has been subverted by the will of the militaryindustrial complex trump is but a pathetic puppet who is taking orders from the generals and his oligarchic friends in wall streetthe socalled exceptional nation the one that never tires of proclaiming its lofty democratic virtues to the rest of the world has

Zakharova Slams CIA Chief Pompeo: Stop Making Up Anti-Russian Fiction,21st century wire says with the ongoing hysteria constantly spouting from the american mainstream media about alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election which saw donald trump elected as president of the united states the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory to date none has surfaced the intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original they ve been doing this for an awfully long time and we are decades into the russians trying to undermine american democracy cia chief mike pompeo told msnbc s hugh hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired saturday june 24russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova has made a noteworthy response to pompeo s commentsvia russia insidertranslation we could not but take note of and comment on the june 24 statement by cia director mike pompeo during his nbc interview the statement dealt with russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the american democracy and meddling in the us elections it appears that in his opinion russia s longtime attempts to undermine the us democracy have culminated in the interference in us elections as we know the issue of russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the united states this story has been adopted by antirussia propagandists this issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to datewe would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of us history unlike the americans we have real facts at our disposal and we know what we should focus on it is common knowledge that since the early 1990s the united states had voiced its intentions to establish a jeffersonian democracy in russia but the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of thomas jefferson one of the founding fathers of the american nation and democracy all of us know he called for respecting various forms of government chosen by other nations and said the united states would not impose its will anywhere he was mistaken thomas jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant brutal and outrageousit appears that the ideologists of the presentday america have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood if the concepts of exporting democracy and humanitarian intervention have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept for decades dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from usimposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern without any consideration for what makes each of them unique this policy and experiments cannot be called harmless in the past few years afghanistan iraq libya egypt syria and ukraine have fallen prey to this concept needless to say alqaeda in all its manifestations isis and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forcesgenerous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and ngos is another grey zone through which the united states has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years russia virtually tops the list of these allocations various government and nongovernment organizations including the peace corps the united states agency for international development usaid the national democratic institute the international republican institute and many other similar agencies have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion according to some sources the us has spent 5 billion dollars for these purposes in the 1990s alone it is very strange that while making such statements mr pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency it is strange that washington forgets the fact that in the runup to the 1996 russian presidential election the federal reserve bank delivered 500 million in cash to the us embassy in moscow under a farfetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old 100 notes operatives from the cia s moscow embassy station headed by michael sulick virtually slept on the money bags while guarding them foreignmade cars delivered small batches of money from the embassy to certain individualswho did the us sponsor using this money i believe we will also learn this someday i do not mean our assumptions everything is clear here well will know the specific names dates and so on here are only a few examples of diverse us activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow american instructions we are in no way demanding that mr pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction one should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction we are ready read more russia news at 21st century wire russia filessupport our work by

GOTCHA! A Stammering John Podesta Stunned by a REAL Question from CBS Reporter,john podesta is hillary clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird that s why this is such a fun video to watch podesta had a brutal exchange on cbs s face the nation on sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on socalled purple states in 2016host nancy cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel robert mueller on friday showed that russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests then she goes in for the kill with this question but it does beg the question how is it that these russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like michigan and wisconsin and your campaign didn t lol that s such a great snarkfilled questiontranscript of full interviewnancy cordes welcome back to face the nation i m nancy cordes our next guest john podesta was the chairman of hillary clinton s 2016 campaign his private emails were hacked and released publicly by russianbacked entities during the campaign mr podesta thank you so much for being with usjohn podesta nice to be back nancynancy cordes for anyone who voted for hillary clinton these new indictments mean whatjohn podesta well look it s a tragedy for the american people really as mr mueller said in his indictment this was an act of information warfare against the united states against our democracy so i think it s obviously disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these russian active measures but i think the real victims here are the american people because there there was direct interference with our democratic institutionsnancy cordes the deputy attorney general was very careful on friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election you ve had a lot time think about this where do you come down on that issuejohn podesta well look this was one part of a of a complex active interference in the measures this didn t even deal with the hacking this was only about what was going on in the social media and the and the information campaign that was being done there but there were 80 people millions of dollars spent and as one of your previous guests senator coons noted we won the popular vote by three million votes they were pushing votes just to give one example to jill stein her vote in michigan in pennsylvania and wisconsin was greater than the gap between donald trump and hillary clinton in those states so you can t prove that it did affect the outcome but it certainly seems likely that it had some impactnancy cordes but it does beg the question how is it that these russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like michigan and wisconsin and your campaign didn tjohn podesta well of course we spent a lot of time energy and effort in all those statesnancy cordes hillary clinton herself did not spend much time in those statesjohn podesta we you know we had tim kaine was there barack obama was in and she spent enormous time in pennsylvania and michigannancy cordes surejohn podesta and we spent a lot of effort we had more staff in wisconsin than even president obama had in 2012 but but i think that begs the question i think we we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest and at the end of the day we fell short in those states and i think that this active measures effort by the russians could have tilted the election in in donald trump s favor but i think what the real issue is is how he s reacted to that and in that context if we re if this is information warfare then i think he s the first draftdodger in the war i mean he has done nothing but tried to undermine the mueller investigation he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the to the activities in the 2016 election we learned this week he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the 2018 electionnancy cordes why do you think that is do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the russians might have influenced this electionjohn podesta well you know i think that mr trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot a lot about it but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him and i think he just constantly tries to move the ball away including what was i think really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the fbi for investigating the russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in florida but you know who knows with mr trump but he clearly i think has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the united states which is to protect our democracynancy cordes midterm elections are coming up and it s been reported that democrats are telling your former boss bill clinton that in light of the me too movement they they think he should sit it out he should be benched and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them is that true and do you think that that s the right calljohn podesta look i think he remains i think a figure who is popular with a lot of democrats across the country and i think that people are calling him candidates are calling him and asking for advice but whether he s going to be an active participant i think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now i think he s doing other things and and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaignnancy cordes do you think it s a good idea very quickly for him to sit it outjohn podesta well you know look i think that that if i was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do i would i would sort of judge whether he can be helpful and i think some places he can be and probably some places he s more of a lightning rodnancy cordes all right john podesta thank you so much campaign chairman for hillary clinton and we ll be right back with our panel of republicans who are leaving the house and senate,politics,18-Feb-18,0

"How The Left, The Anti Defamation League and Media Used Fake Information To Publish HUGE LIE About High School Killer’s Ties To “White Nationalist”",immediately after the police identified the suspect in the florida high school massacre as 19yearold nikolas cruz the media began to scour social media desperate to find any ties cruz may have had to the right  in the media s narrow minds you can t be a gun owner and not be tied to the republican party the republican party and the nra must be held accountable and they must be held accountable at all costs even at the cost of being accurate or truthful when the media couldn t find any facts to report they immediately began to scour social media for hints what they got was a bunch of social media trolls who thought it would be funny to lead the mainstream media on with lies about the shooter the mainstream media and the anti defamation league who ironically claims to defend people who are victims of discrimination yet works overtime to demonize anyone whose views are to the right of theirs had to settle for fake ties to the massacre suspect and white supremacist group in tallahassee floridaunfortunately both the media and the anti defamation league s stories quickly fell apart when they were outed for not having done their homework to properly vet the comments made on an open chat social media platform called 4chanon thursday afternoon the antidefamation league reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with nikolas cruz who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people including many highschool students at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland floridafrom the anti defamation league s websitea spokesperson for the white supremacist group republic of florida rof claimed to the antidefamation league on thursday february 15 that nikolas cruz the man charged with the previous day s deadly shooting spree at a parkland florida high school was associated with his groupupdate on thursday afternoon following news reports of the alleged association between cruz and the republic of florida a member of an alt right discussion forum wrote that all of the claims were false and were part of an elaborate attempt to troll a network news reporter and other media outlets at a press conference thursday afternoon the broward county sheriff said a connection was not confirmed at this time but that law enforcement was still investigatingcruz 19 a former student at marjory stoneman douglas high school allegedly entered the school wednesday february 14 with an ar15 and opened fire killing at least 17 people and injuring 14 more cruz left the scene but was later captured by police and has been charged with premeditated murderafter selfdescribed rof members

to be the leader of rof in 2016 he was arrested on charges of threatening a staffer in the office of florida governor rick scott because he was allegedly angry at the staffer s sonjereb said that cruz was associated with rof having been brought up by another member jereb also claimed that cruz had participated in one or more rof training exercises in the tallahassee area carpooling with other rof members from south floridarof has members in north and south florida the alt right white supremacist group borrows paramilitary concepts from the antigovernment extremist militia movement not itself a white supremacist movement rof describes itself as a white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics and seeks to create a white ethnostate in florida most rof members are young and the group itself is only a few years oldjereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shootingif cruz s role is confirmed the parkland school shooting

antidefamation league on thursday february 15 that nikolas cruz   was associated with his group the adl reported the adl quoted a man named jordan jereb who runs the small group which is based in tallahassee jereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shooting the adl wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by abc news and the associated press and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets even the daily stormer a neonazi website picked up the claimsome outlets reported they had their own conversations with jereb or classmates of cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of cruz with rofbut a few hours later after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking cruz to rof jereb said his identification of cruz was a misunderstanding and that he too had been the subject of a prank on online forums and twitter trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed politico reports all of our evidence seems to point to the adl getting this wrong said joan donovan a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for data  society a think tank in new york citythe adl subsequently revised its report as did many news outlets adl shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events an adl spokesperson said in a statement on friday confirmation of whether cruz was part of rof is now in the hands of law enforcement and that s what the broward sheriff s team is looking into the adl traced its original tip to posts on 4chan where researchers found selfdescribed rof members claiming that cruz was a brotherinarms but many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researcherson wednesday an anonymous 4chan user posted about receiving a message on instagram from an abc news reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew cruz prime trolling opportunity another user replied you have to take advantage of this a third chimed inhe asked for proof of the reporter s identity according to posted screenshots from their correspondence the reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an abc identification badgesome on the 4chan thread joked about sending back obscene

PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS The Perfect New Years Message…It’s Who He Included In His Tweet That Has Everyone LAUGHING!,as 2017 comes to a close we d like to acknowledge our gratitude to president trump who is truly a gift to america he came at a time when we needed him most he came at a time when we the people were watching our freedoms and rights being stripped away by an outofcontrol government he came at a time when educators were teaching our youth that america was the enemy he came at a time when american citizens were being forced to cede our country to unvetted foreign invaders and illegal aliens in exchange for democrat party votes he came at a time when democrats celebrities and the media were shaming gun owners and christians for their conservative beliefs and where daring to say merry christmas was a borderline punishable offense he gave up a successful business and time spent with his closeknit family to step into a hornet s nest like no one could ever have imagined but he did it because he believed in the greatness of america and in defending that greatness no matter the personal cost that s what makes his new years tweet so perfectpresident trump took time tonight to wish his supporters enemies the very dishonest fake news media and even his haters a happy and healthy 2018 as we say goodbye to an incredibly successful 2017 led by an incredibly successful president we d like to thank president trump for the incredible sacrifices he s made on behalf of every american even those who don t yet understand to make america great againpresident trump tweeted as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter i want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest fake news media a happy and healthy new year 2018 will be a great year for america as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter i want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest fake news media a happy and healthy new year 2018 will be a great year for america donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 31 2017as a special tribute to president trump as he wraps up his unbelievably successful first year we d like to share this powerful article written by evan sayet the article brilliantly explains why america loves the fighter donald j trump he fightsmy leftist friends as well as many ardent nevertrumpers constantly ask me if i m not bothered by donald trump s lack of decorum they ask if i don t think his tweets are beneath the dignity of the office here s my answerwe rightthinking people have tried dignity there could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than george w bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency we tried statesmanship could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized collegiality as john mccain we tried propriety has there been a nicer human being ever than mitt romney and the results were always the samethis is because while we were playing by the rules of dignity collegiality and propriety the left has been for the past 60 years engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of saul alinsky and the chicago mobi don t find anything dignified collegial or proper about barack obama s lying about what went down on the streets of ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the democratic party i don t see anything dignified in lying about the deaths of four americans in benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks i don t see anything statesmanlike in weaponizing the irs to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent yes obama was articulate and polished but in no way was he in the least bit dignified collegial or proper the left has been engaged in a war against america since the rise of the children of the 60s to them it has been an allout war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale it has been a war they ve fought with violence the threat of violence demagoguery and lies from day one the violent takeover of the universities till todaythe problem is through these years the left has been the only side fighting this war while the left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way the right has continued to act with dignity collegiality and proprietywith donald trump this all has come to an end donald trump is america s first wartime president in the culture warduring wartime things like dignity and collegiality simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors ulysses grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the army for conduct unbecoming had abraham lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted grant the democrats might well still be holding their slaves today lincoln rightly recognized that i cannot spare this man he fights general george patton was a vulgartalking sonofabitch in peacetime this might have seen him stripped of rank but had franklin roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum then hitler and the socialists would barely be five decades into their thousandyear reichtrump is fighting and what s particularly delicious is that like patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated rommel s he s shouting you magnificent bastards i read your book that is just the icing on the cake but it s wonderful to see that not only is trump fighting he s defeating the left using their own tacticsthat book is saul alinsky s rules for radicals a book so essential to the liberals war against america that it is and was the playbook for the entire obama administration and the subject of hillary clinton s senior thesis it is a book of such pure evil that just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted alinsky dedicated his book to lucifertrump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but in reality he is doing exactly what alinsky suggested his followers do first instead of going after the fake media and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong but diametrically opposed to the truth from the tet offensive to benghazi to what really happened on the streets of ferguson missouri trump has isolated cnn he made it personal then just as alinsky suggests he employs ridicule which alinsky described as the most powerful weapon of all everyone gets that it s not just cnn in fact in a world where al sharpton and rachel maddow paul krugman and nicholas kristof are people of influence and whose reporting is in no way significantly different than cnn s cnn is just a pikermost importantly trump s tweets have put cnn in an untenable and unwinnable position with trump s ability to go around them they cannot simply stand pat they need to respond this leaves them with only two choicesthey can either go high as hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can doubledown on their usual tactics and hope to defeat trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguerythe problem for cnn et al with the former is if they were to start honestly reporting the news that would be the end of the democratic party they serve it is nothing but the incessant use of fake news read propaganda that keeps the left alive imagine for example if cnn had honestly and accurately reported thencandidate barack obama s close ties to foreign terrorists rashid khalidi domestic terrorists william ayers the mafia tony rezko or the true evils of his spiritual mentor jeremiah wright s churchimagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the obama administration s weaponizing of the irs to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of ambassador christopher stevens and the obama administration s coverup this makes going high a nonstarter for cnn this leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news conjuring up the next nothing burger and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s worse than nixon this obviously is what cnn has chosen to do the problem is as they become more and more hysterical they become more and more obvious each new effort at even faker news than before and faker outrage only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that trump is and always has been right about the fake news mediaand by causing their hysteria trump has forced them into numerous highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes thus in their desperation they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that even with the liberal lower case l  libel laws protecting the media they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedlytheir flailing at trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality with cnn using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an internet meme this threat to dox release of personal information to encourage coideologists to visit violence upon him and his family a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him if it were there would have been no reason for cnn to have made their deal with him publicinstead cnn playing by chicago rules was sending a message to any and all dissent will not be tolerated this heavyhanded and hysterical response to a joke on the internet has backfired on cnn giving rise to only more righteous ridiculeso to my friends on the left and the nevertrumpers as well do i wish we lived in a time when our president could be collegial and dignified and proper  of course i do these aren t those times this is war and it s a war that the left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 yearsso say anything you want about this president i get it he can be vulgar he can be crude he can be

WATCH: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM DROPS BOMBSHELL… FINALLY Confirms The Fake Russian Dossier Was Used To Obtain FISA Warrant To Spy On Trump,everyone suspected the sketchy steele dossier was what corrupt fbi and doj officials used to get the october 2016 fisa warrant against trump fbi and doj officials refuse to answer that question publiclyrep ron desantis rfl said in a statement we now know that the socalled steele dossier was paid for by the democratic party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding thencandidate trump what the american people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by steele on the democrats dime was used by the obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against trump associates the fbi has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of congress the trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against trump or his associates immediately after his inauguration president trump came out swinging over the fake russian dossier he even went as far as to blame the intelligence community president trump was immediately criticized for his comments and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory as it turns out he wasn t too far off the markct despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question and despite numerous oncamera questions to fbi and doj officials about the 2016 fisa process noone had definitively confirmed the christopher steele russian dossier was the underlying evidence for the 2016 fisa application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate donald trump until nowsenator lindsey graham just confirmed the sketchy steele dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the fisa court brian kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it watch at starting at the 0410 mark the backstory to the fisa warrant is the cornerstone the backstory contains both the fbi and the doj scheme expose it remove it and the entire muh russia conspiracy collapses under the weight of sunlight this is critical and important because the specific use of the steele dossier underpins the big ugly and exposes the entire toptier apparatus of the fbi counterintelligence division peter strzok bill priestap james baker andrew mccabe and the doj national security division john carlin stuart evans mary mccord and sally yates as well as doj bruce ohr and fbi lawyer lisa page directly to conspiracy chargesthe 2016 fbi counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the trump campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a fisa warrant sold as a defense of us democracy from russia which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etcthe doj involvement surrounds legal arguments processing of fisa applications and use of the legal system to support the fbi operation with actionable legal framing against trump the doj national security division carried out that collaboration with the fbitablet mag did a deep dive into the fusiongps connection to the creation of the steele dossier and more specifically how fusiongps head glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the white house prior to the doj and fbi applying for the fisa warrant see heretablet mag outlines how mary jacoby even bragged about getting the russiagate narrative starteda tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the nowfamous dossier suggests that central elements of the russiagate scandal emerged not from the british exspy christopher steele s topsecret sources in the russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from russian government control but from a series of stories that fusion gps cofounder glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby cowrote for thewall street journal well before fusion gps existed and donald trump was simply another loudmouthed manhattan real estate millionaireunderstanding the origins of the steele dossier is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the united states  in a facebook post from june 24 2017 that tablet has seen in screenshots jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for russiagate she has not replied to repeated requests for comment it s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what glenn s role was in exposing putin s control of donald trump jacoby wrote let s be clear glenn conducted the investigation glenn hired chris steele chris steele worked for glenn this assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the steele dossier on which the russiagate narrative is founded read morethe tabletmag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished steele dossier entering into the white house and how president obama likely saw and reviewed the contenthowever missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefariousremember previous media reporting in conjunction with clinton campaign admissions have confirmed the dnc and clinton campaign financed fusiongps through their lawyers within perkins coie fusion then hired nellie ohr the wife of doj deputy bruce ohr who thereafter subcontracted with retired british mi6 agent christopher steele to writeresearchprovide credibility for the dossier the dates here are important because they tell a storythe origin of the clinton effort with fusiongps was april 2016 that s the same month fusion hired nellie ohr wife of doj deputy bruce ohr to gather opposition research on candidate trump it would be most likely that nellie ohr was in contact with christopher steele doj deputy attorney bruce ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with christopher steele and fusiongps founder glenn simpson in october 2016 the same month the fisa warrant was grantedhowever there was another event in this april 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the dossier origination hat tip katica check this outin april 2016 mary jacoby shows up on white house visitor logs meeting with president obama officials in april 2016 the clinton campaign and dnc hired fusiongps to organize the russia research that later became known as the steele dossier link to white house logsthe wife of glenn simpson fusion gps mary b jacoby with years of russiaangled reporting including donald trump visits the white house in april 2016 at the same time as the dnc and clinton hire fusion gps to conduct the opposition research on donald trump surrounding russiathis timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidentalexpand slightly and considerapril mary jacoby wife of fusion gps founder glenn simpson visits the white house the clinton campaign and dnc then hire fusion gps to conduct opposition research  with a russian emphasis fusion gps then hires nellie ohr who specializes in russiancentric counterintelligence nellie ohr then contacts mi6 agent christopher steele to write a russian dossier a month later may 2016 nellie ohr s husband inside the doj bruce ohr is then working with fbi counterintelligence head peter strzok by june 2016 peter strzok bruce ohr and doj attorney lisa page then apply for the first fisa warrantjune 24th 2017 mary jacoby appears on facebook taking credit for the origination of the russiagate narrativethis timeline is so transparent it s deafeningmore from the tablet simpson and jacoby had id d manafort as a worldclass sleazeball and they were right a slick georgetown law grad running in gop circles since the reagan campaign manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people i would only add here that in my personal experience journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written especially stories with a character like manafort at the centerso when the trump campaign named paul manafort as its campaign convention manager on march 28 2016 you can bet that simpson and jacoby s eyes lit up and as it happened at the exact same time that trump hired manafort fusion gps was in negotiations with perkins coie the law firm representing the clinton campaign and the dnc to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the trump campaign they had started for the washington free beacon moremary jacoby and glenn simpson fusion gpsif the

BILL NYE The FAKE Science Guy THREATENS Conservatives…Blue States Will “Impose Economic Sanctions” Against Climate Change Denying States,friday on msnbc climate activist bill nye warned conservatives to watch out saying progressive blue states will address climate change on their ownnye said only 40 percent of people in the us think that congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups especially from the fossil fuel industry have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty plus or minus two percent is the same as plus or minus 100 percent he continued there s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writlarge states rights just watch out conservatives if states rights include california illinois new york these places that where people voted in a progressive fashion watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions either overtly or by default on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way he added we ve got to remind people that we re all in this together the people i think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies we want to engage everybody not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest it is not in the best interest especially of your children and grandchildren a couple of times you mentioned that i am against the president and so on i m not especially against the president i just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future this is true not just with regard to the national debt which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved ronald reagan not only will that national debt increase but the climate debt in a sense what we have to do to address climate change will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down breitbart newsthe climate change debate went nuclear last year over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the national oceanic and atmospheric association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming pause in an article on the climate etc blog john bates who retired last year as principal scientist of the national climatic data center accused the lead author of the 2015 noaa pausebuster report of trying to discredit the hiatus through flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards in addition mr bates told the daily uk mail that the report s author former noaa national centers for environmental information director thomas karl did so by insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation gradually in the months after the report came out the evidence kept mounting that tom karl constantly had his thumb on the scale in the documentation scientific choices and release of datasets in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy mr bates said saturday on climate etcthe june 2015 report possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus which updated the ocean temperature record was published six months before the un s paris summitthe accusations sparked a fierce backandforth sunday between socalled climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of mr bates claim which he defended on the climate etc blog run by former georgia tech climatologist judith curryzeke hausfather berkeley earth climate scientist said in a sunday factcheck on the carbonbrief blog that the karl paper s conclusions have been validated by independent data from satellites buoys and argo floats and many other independent groups while noaa s data management procedures may well need improvement their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups mr hausfather said citing berkeley earth and the uk s met office hadley centrehe said the record strongly suggests that noaa got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years meanwhile the whistleblowing prompted a wetoldyouso moment from republicans on the house science space and technology committee who have long suspected the obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 19982013 pause in global temperature increases now that dr bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within noaa about the quality and transparency of the data before publication we know why noaa fought transparency and oversight at every turn said chairman lamar smith in a sunday statementthe panel launched an investigation into the noaa pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the socalled clean power plan and upcoming paris climate conference dr bates revelations and noaa s obstruction certainly lend credence to what i ve expected all along that the karl study used flawed data was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored noaa s own standards for scientific study mr smith saidmr bates said he decided to come forward after reading a washington post article dec 13 that said federal scientists are frantically copying us climate data fearing it might vanish under trump as a climate scientist formerly responsible for noaa s climate archive the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data he said on climate etcin his experience the most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of tom karl et al 2015 hereafter referred to as the karl study or k15 purporting to show no hiatus in global warming in the 2000s noaa did not return immediately sunday a request for comment the daily mail said that mr karl admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published but denied trying to influence the climate summit asked why he had not waited he said john bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time he denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for

WHY THIS Democrat Stronghold County Voted For Trump…And Why They’ll Vote For Him Again: “He’s a fighter…nobody’s gonna push him into a corner” [VIDEO],ap news the regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table the one next to an old box television playing the news on mutesteven whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the frosty freeze his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a halfcentury ago coffee is 50 cents a cup refills 25 cents the pot sits on the counter and payment is based on the honor systempeople like it that way he thinks it reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here in god s country in this small county isolated in the foothills of the appalachian mountainseveryone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking and recently news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics because elliott county a bluecollar union stronghold voted for the democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147year existenceuntil donald trump came along and promised to wind back the clock he was the hope we were all waiting on the guy riding up on the white horse there was a new energy about everybody here says whitt i still see it despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of trump s white workingclass basethe frenetic churn of the national news the ceaseless twitter taunts the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen rarely registering when they do trump doesn t shoulder the blame because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economicit means god guns patriotism saying merry christmas and not happy holidays it means validation of their indignation about a changing nation gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas it means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world awayon those counts they believe trump has delivered even if his promised bluecollar renaissance has not yet materialized he s punching at all the people who let them down for so long the presidential embodiment of their own discontent he s already done enough to get my vote again without a doubt no question wes lewis a retired pipefitter and one of whitt s regulars declares as he deals the day s first hand of cardshe thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life and if they don t he believes they would have if democrats and republicans and the media all crooked as a barrel of fishhooks had gotten out of the way what lewis has now that he didn t have before trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him one thing i hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner says whitt 35 he s a fighter i think they like the bluntness of it he plops down at an empty table next to the card game drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes bill bill bill he reports to his wife chesla who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together he needs to run home and change of out his frosty freeze uniform the first of several work ensembles he wears each day and put on his second a suit and tie he also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner elected as a democratthe whitts like many people here cobble together a living with a couple jobs each sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day because there aren t many options better than minimum wage there s the school system and a prison and that s pretty much it outside of town population 622 roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too then up into the hills of appalachia with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the american imaginationwhitt slides a medical bill across the table looks like this one is the new helmet he says and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt 3995 they will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed 40000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition his skull was shaped like an egg the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be tommy their baby boy with big blue eyes has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they shouldthey pay 800 a month for insurance but when they took their baby to a surgeon in cincinnati they learned it was out of network innetwork hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries so they opted to pay out of pocket at the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor it would have all been freethis represents the cracks in america s institutions that drove whitt a lifelong democrat from supporting president barack obama to buying a make america great again cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch many of their welfaredependent neighbors he believes stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead where s the fairness in that he asksbut whitt doesn t blame trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better he blames the brick wall in washington the politicians he sees as blocking everything trump proposes while small people like them in small places like this are left again to languisha third of people here live in poverty just 9 percent of adults have a college degree but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do and those jobs have gotten harder to findmany here blame global trade agreements and the war on coal environmental regulations designed by obama s administration to curb carbon emissions for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs when trump bemoans the american carnage of lost factories and lost faith it feels like he s talking to the people in these appalachian hills when he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way they embrace himcoal has ticked up since trump took office mining companies have added 1200 jobs across the country since his inauguration more than 180 of them in kentucky but industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation far cheaper natural gas mechanization thinning appalachian seams with the opposition he s had i think he s pulling the plow pretty good offers wes lewis from the card table a few months ago he says he saw four brandnew coal rigs going through town for the longest time under obama all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers because people turned belly up they went broke lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work he s noticed new trucks in people s driveways too which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures these tiny signs

"WHY THIS BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRAT STRONGHOLD County Is Still Fighting For Trump: “He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse” [VIDEO]",ap news the regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table the one next to an old box television playing the news on mutesteven whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the frosty freeze his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a halfcentury ago coffee is 50 cents a cup refills 25 cents the pot sits on the counter and payment is based on the honor systempeople like it that way he thinks it reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here in god s country in this small county isolated in the foothills of the appalachian mountainseveryone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking and recently news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics because elliott county a bluecollar union stronghold voted for the democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147year existenceuntil donald trump came along and promised to wind back the clock he was the hope we were all waiting on the guy riding up on the white horse there was a new energy about everybody here says whitt i still see it despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of trump s white workingclass basethe frenetic churn of the national news the ceaseless twitter taunts the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen rarely registering when they do trump doesn t shoulder the blame because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economicit means god guns patriotism saying merry christmas and not happy holidays it means validation of their indignation about a changing nation gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas it means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world awayon those counts they believe trump has delivered even if his promised bluecollar renaissance has not yet materialized he s punching at all the people who let them down for so long the presidential embodiment of their own discontent he s already done enough to get my vote again without a doubt no question wes lewis a retired pipefitter and one of whitt s regulars declares as he deals the day s first hand of cardshe thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life and if they don t he believes they would have if democrats and republicans and the media all crooked as a barrel of fishhooks had gotten out of the way what lewis has now that he didn t have before trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him one thing i hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner says whitt 35 he s a fighter i think they like the bluntness of it he plops down at an empty table next to the card game drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes bill bill bill he reports to his wife chesla who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together he needs to run home and change of out his frosty freeze uniform the first of several work ensembles he wears each day and put on his second a suit and tie he also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner elected as a democratthe whitts like many people here cobble together a living with a couple jobs each sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day because there aren t many options better than minimum wage there s the school system and a prison and that s pretty much it outside of town population 622 roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too then up into the hills of appalachia with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the american imaginationwhitt slides a medical bill across the table looks like this one is the new helmet he says and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt 3995 they will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed 40000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition his skull was shaped like an egg the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be tommy their baby boy with big blue eyes has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they shouldthey pay 800 a month for insurance but when they took their baby to a surgeon in cincinnati they learned it was out of network innetwork hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries so they opted to pay out of pocket at the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor it would have all been freethis represents the cracks in america s institutions that drove whitt a lifelong democrat from supporting president barack obama to buying a make america great again cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch many of their welfaredependent neighbors he believes stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead where s the fairness in that he asksbut whitt doesn t blame trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better he blames the brick wall in washington the politicians he sees as blocking everything trump proposes while small people like them in small places like this are left again to languisha third of people here live in poverty just 9 percent of adults have a college degree but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do and those jobs have gotten harder to findmany here blame global trade agreements and the war on coal environmental regulations designed by obama s administration to curb carbon emissions for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs when trump bemoans the american carnage of lost factories and lost faith it feels like he s talking to the people in these appalachian hills when he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way they embrace himcoal has ticked up since trump took office mining companies have added 1200 jobs across the country since his inauguration more than 180 of them in kentucky but industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation far cheaper natural gas mechanization thinning appalachian seams with the opposition he s had i think he s pulling the plow pretty good offers wes lewis from the card table a few months ago he says he saw four brandnew coal rigs going through town for the longest time under obama all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers because people turned belly up they went broke lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work he s noticed new trucks in people s driveways too which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures

WHY FINAL “Sunday Night Football” Game Was Canceled… Is Low Attendance The Reason?,the nfl announced tuesday that the final sunday night football game of the season has been canceled was it due to low attendance in previous weeks well it s part of the reason low attendance has been plaguing the league since the kneeling controversy took holdrecently a liberal news source tried to downplay the boycott from nfl fans by citing injuries from key star athletes in the nfl as the reason for low interest in games we think the kneeling controversy has more to do with the lack of interest in games it s being reported that the attendance is down 9 from last yearwe ve seen stadiums with hundreds of empty seats along with low viewershipthere are a few other reasons why the game was canceled but low attendance was certainly part of itdaily caller reportsthe league had yet to announce who would play during the primetime game next sunday but with the chance that none of the matchups would have playoff implications for one or both of the teams they opted not to schedule the gamenew year s evethe other problem the league faced was broadcasting a game on new year s eve which would invite lower number of viewers traditionally on that night we felt that both from a competitive standpoint and from a fan perspective the most fair thing to do is to schedule all week 17 games in either the 1 pm or 425 pm windows nfl broadcast chief howard katz said in a statementthe last time a sunday night football game took place on the final night of the year was in 2006 when the chicago bears hosted the green bay packers that game was hall of fame member brett favre s final game with the packers despite that fact the game only drew 134 million viewers which for that season was a quarter of the typical audience for snf in a season plagued with lower ratings due to the national anthem protests the league s decision was not surprising,politics,26-Dec-17,0

PRESIDENT TRUMP Calls Out Corrupt FBI Clinton Crony for Alleged ‘Misuse’ of FBI Email,you just can t make this level of cronyism up it s a blatant disregard for laws rules and just about everything else unethical but this is the clintons so the rules don t apply to them they are sickeningly corrupt grifters who have been able to get away with just about everything for decades it s time to call them out and hold them accountable for their lawlessness the american people need to be able to trust their government will follow the rule of law the time is now president trump tweeted out to call out the fbi s andrew mccabe on his cronyism with the clintons and misuse of fbi emailpresident trump tweeted sunday that fbi deputy director andrew mccabe allegedly used his official agency email account to promote his wife s failed 2015 attempt to win as a democrat a virginia state senate seatfoxnewsfbi s andrew mccabe in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m clinton puppet he was using allegedly his fbi official email account to promote her campaign you obviously cannot do this these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 24 2017 the president has long been a critic of the fbi s cronyism with the clintons our previous report on what went on when andrew mccabe s wife ran for virginia state senate is unbelievably corruptour report on the clinton crony back in october spells out the corruptionhow much more criminal activity are american voters willing to overlook have we as americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by hillary or anyone attached to hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in america the political organization of virginia gov terry mcauliffe an influential democrat with longstanding ties to bill and hillary clinton gave nearly 500000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the federal bureau of investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into mrs clinton s email usecampaign finance records show mr mcauliffe s politicalaction committee donated 467500 to the 2015 state senate campaign of dr jill mccabe who is married to andrew mccabe now the deputy director of the fbithe virginia democratic party over which mr mcauliffe exerts considerable control donated an additional 207788 worth of support to dr mccabe s campaign in the form of mailers according to the records that adds up to slightly more than 675000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under mr mcauliffe s control or strongly influenced by him the figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds dr mccabe raised in the effortmr mcauliffe and other state party leaders recruited dr mccabe to run according to party officials she lost the election to incumbent republican dick blacka spokesman for the governor said he supported jill mccabe because he believed she would be a good state senator this is a customary practice for virginia governors any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous among political candidates that year dr mccabe was the thirdlargest recipient of funds from common good va the governor s pac according to campaign finance records dan gecker received 781500 from the pac and 214456 from the state party for a campaign that raised 29 million according to records and jeremy mcpike received 803500 from the pac and 535162 from the state party raising more 38 million that year for his candidacythe governor could recall only one meeting with mr mccabe when he and other state democrats met with the couple on march 7 2015 to urge dr mccabe to run according to the spokesmanthe fbi said in a statement that during his wife s campaign mr mccabe played no role attended no events and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind months after the completion of her campaign thenassociate deputy director mccabe was promoted to deputy where in that position he assumed for the first time an oversight role in the investigation into secretary clinton s emails fbi officials said that after that meeting with the governor in richmond on march 7 mr mccabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in virginia and avoiding any campaign activity or eventsmr mccabe s supervision of the clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and mr mcauliffe wasn t part of the email probe officials said once i decided to run dr mccabe said my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children as a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate mr mccabe is a longtime fbi official who focused much of his career on terrorism his wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern virginia where the couple live with their childrenthe 2015 virginia state senate race was dr mccabe s first run for office and her campaign spent 18 million the race was part of mr mcauliffe s failed effort to win a democratic majority in the virginia legislature which would have given him significantly more sway in richmond the state capitalmr mcauliffe has been a central figure in the clintons political careers for decades in the 1990s he was bill clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters mrs clinton appeared with him in northern virginia in 2015 as he

WHY OBAMA’S CORRUPT INNER CIRCLE Is Desperately Fighting To Protect His Failed Reputation, history shows that we can if we must tolerate nuclear weapons in north korea those words were written by former national security adviser susan rice on thursday in the new york times in arguing for appeasement towards kim jongunit was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with barack obama s feckless foreign policy and it explains why the world that president donald trump inherited is so dangerous and unstablethe obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the us could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone breitbartnoah rothman of commentary magazine wrote a brilliant article about the death rattle of obama s reputation  in his article rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former president barack obama took our nation down and why the successes of president trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against trump in defense of obama s failed legacythe members of barack obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual former cia director john brennan accused donald trump and his administration of engaging in outrageous narcissistic behavior typical of vengeful autocrats by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the united states in the united nations as though that were unprecedented it is not james clapper obama s director of national intelligence all but alleged that the president is a russian asset perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former democratic president s foreignpolicy professionals were placed in the new york times by obama s national security advisor susan rice in her estimation america has abdicated its role as a force for good rice s attacks on the republican administration deserve the most attention if only because they are the most apoplectic donald trump s recently released nationalsecurity review paints a dark almost dystopian vision of the world rice contended his world is full of hostile states and lurking threats rice claimed that there is no common good in trump s worldview what s more there is no international community and no universal values there are just american values rice acknowledges that moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace western values and us sovereignty she implies that trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that in fact it was obama much more so than trump who has failed to see the obviousbarack obama was inarguably the least atlanticist president since the end of world war ii within a year of russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former soviet republic of georgia obama scrapped george w bushera agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to central europe in 2013 the last of america s armored combat units left europe ending a 69year footprint on the continent by 2014 there were just two us army brigades stationed in europe the folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when vladimir putin became the first russian leader since stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring ukrainea year later putin intervened militarily in syria where us forces were already operating resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the cold war putin s move in syria should not have come as a surprise barack obama outsourced the resolution of the syrian conflict to moscow in 2013 if only to avoid making good on his selfset red line for intervention in that conflict despite the normshattering use of wmds on civilians even rice s chief complaint about trump his failure to condemn putin s brazen intervention in the 2016 election didn t elicit a reaction from barack obama until the final month of his presidencyby contrast and to the surprise of just about everyone the trump administration has been tough on russia trump has ordered harsh sanctions on moscow s iranian allies for violating united nations resolutions a course the obama administration declined to take even if it allowed hezbollah terrorists with direct links to putin to operate with impunity he ordered long overdue airstrikes on putin s vassal regime in syria halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process trump not only declined to lift obamaera sanctions on moscow as many feared he would but expanded them this administration closed russian consulates and annexes in the united states it has targeted putin allies like chechen strongman ramzan kadyrov under the magnitsky act the same act that kremlin cutout natalia veselnitskaya lobbied the trump campaign to scuttle trump has even gone so far as to open us arms sales to ukraine representing a significant blow to putin s ambitions in europe it is without a doubt that trump now has a stronger record on russia than barack obama ever did no wonder susan rice is so angryrice further alleged that trump recklessly accused china of being an avowed opponent of the us rather than just a competitor and then insisted that china has not illegally occupied its neighbors tell that to brunei malaysia the philippines vietnam or taiwan each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the south china sea that the people s republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases rice suggested that trump s realists decided to lump beijing in with moscow not because it is a rising military and economic power but because they wanted to placate american nationalists though this white house declined to defibrillate the transpacific partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with beijing to isolate pyongyang than obama did as the north korean nuclear crisis intensifies china has backed fresh sanctions on north korean financial institutions cut off all access to chinese iron lead and coal and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the stalinist state by as much as 90 percent and all in the space of one yearrice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the us should labor lgbt people people in poverty people with aids people under 30 et cetera rather the document insists that all mankind regardless of conditions or accidents of birth are objects of us interest rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security good climate change is not itself a threat to american national security but a threat multiplier as the weather has always been save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of us freetrade obligations rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante in nearly all respects it was obama s white house not trump s that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the us and the world less safe as a resulteven as early as march of 2017 it was clear that the obama administration s foreignpolicy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of american interests abroad they had every reason to be for now at least the trump administration has declined to govern as trump campaigned not as a populist firebrand but a conventional republican susan rice and her former white house colleagues have every reason to worry but not for the united states their reputations however are another matter entirelyto read the entire article click here ,politics,23-Dec-17,0

‘Classified’ Emails from Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin found on Anthony Weiner’s Laptop,looking back on the 2016 presidential election there was a nonstop chorus on denials by hillary clinton her campaign surrogates and the mainstream media that had not allowed any classified emails to float around her homebrew server or onto the family of her close aidsas it turns out hillary clinton was lying a new batch of emails released by the us state department clearly show that anthony weiner convicted sex criminal and husband of clinton s chief aid huma abedin had kept classified emails pertaining to official us state department business during hillary clinton s tenure as secretary of state kept on the same laptop which weiner used to target an underage girl and where he also kept child pornographyamong the released emails were exchanges which clearly show hillary clinton conspiracy with authoritarian saudi arabia to stop wikileaks the reopening of this old clinton gaping wound is another devastating blow for the mainstream media and the democratic party s resistance movement whose mission is to remove donald trump for officert international reports at least five of the 2800 emails stored on a laptop belonging to former democratic congressman anthony weiner were marked confidential and involved delicate talks with middle eastern leaders and hillary clinton s top aideon friday the state department released a batch of around 2800 workrelated documents from the email account of huma abedin who served as the deputy chief of staff to former secretary of state hillary clintonat least five of the emails found on abedin s exhusband s laptop were heavily redacted and marked classified and at confidential level the third more sensitive class the us government uses below secret and top secret the state department applies the confidential classification level to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security according to the government publishing officewhile the documents were not marked as classified before they were released some of the information recovered in the emails was considered classified it is illegal for civilians to posses or read classified documents without a security clearancethe confidential emails which date from 2010 to 2012 concern discussions with middle eastern leadersdishonest despite being caught multiple times hillary clinton is still in denial about mishandling classified materialone of the emails has the subject egyptian mfa on hamasplo talks referring to the palestine liberation organization the email is mostly redacted only mentioning that it is a further update on hamaspa talks referring to the palestinian authorityanother fourpage email contains a completely redacted call sheet to prepare clinton for an upcoming call with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahua call sheet in another 2010 email includes notes to guide clinton through a call she would make to saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal the purpose of the call was to inform saud about an impending wikileaks disclosure this appears to be the result of an illegal act in which a fully cleared intelligence officer stole information and gave it to a website the person responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law the call sheet instructed clinton to sayclinton was warning the saudis the leak could contain information related to private conversations with your government on iraq iran and afghanistan and asked the saudi s to help the us prevent wikileaks from undermining our mutual interests during a congressional hearing in 2016 former fbi director james comey said abedin regularly forwarded emails to weiner for him to print out for her so she could deliver them to the secretary of state the emails were released in response to a 2015 lawsuit filed by conservative watchdog group judicial watch against the state department after it failed to respond to a freedom of information request foia seeking all emails of official state department business received or sent by former deputy chief of staff huma abedin from january 1 2009 through february 1 2013 using a non stategov email address in a statement issued friday judicial watch president tom fitton called the release a major victory adding that it was no surprise there were classified documents on weiner s computer it will be in keeping with our past experience that abedin s emails on weiner s laptop will include classified and other sensitive materials fitton said in a statement that these government docs were on anthony weiner s laptop dramatically illustrates the need for the justice department to finally do a serious investigation of hillary clinton s and huma abedin s obvious violations of law the emails were discovered on weiner s laptop during an fbi investigation into allegations that he engaged in sexting with a 15yearold girl in september weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to sending obscene material to a minorthe discovery of the emails led comey to announce that the fbi was reopening an investigation into clinton s use of a private email server 11 days before the 2016 presidential election clinton said the announcement contributed to her loss to donald trump see more at rtlast year in effort to shoreup clinton s crumbling reputation for being truthful to the public her campaign published a bizarre 4000word fact sheet on the clinton campaign websiteas it turned out clinton s fact sheet was riddled with numerous false statements and other halftruths including a lie that the fbi was conducting a security review when it was in fact conducting an investigation and that she

US Advising Soldiers to Be ‘Less Masculine’ as Military Tries to Curb Flood of Sexual Harassment Cases,170619naa175092san diego june 19 2017 command master chief ret kathleen henson from midland mich center and uss makin island lhd 8 sailors cut a cake during the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender pride month observance makin island is homeported in san diego us navy photo by mass communication specialist 2nd class eric zeak published at wikicommons21st century wire says while military forces are fighting one enemy in the theatre of combat another multifront culture war is also being fought within their institutions according to a recent report in militarycom us military lawyers have begun speaking about how sexual assault cases are flooding the military courts threatening to break the back of the military s legal system and perhaps radically alter the institutional cultureafter the release of the documentary the invisible war the issue of sexual assault in the military has again been thrust into the national spotlight claiming that 1 in 5 us female veterans have sustained some form of sexual assaultthe issue of sexual assault in the us military first rose to national prominence in 1992 with the emergence of the infamous tailhook scandal one likely reason for this new spike in reported cases could be because each military service branch has recently implemented new awareness programs as well as sexual assault prevention campaigns which actively encourage female troops to report anything they might feel constitutes sexual harassment or a constitutes a sexual assaultthis also comes at a time where the us military has undergone the gradual process of becoming more gay friendly in order to advance issues of equality and to cater for its growing ranks of lgbt service men and womenmilitarycom explains how the new liberal progressive agenda may be adversely affecting operations military lawyers said the pentagon leadership has the right intentions but these prevention campaigns have flooded military court rooms with so many sexual assault cases it s made it harder to prosecute guilty sexual predatorsprosecutors lack witnesses or strong evidence in the majority of cases making it hard to yield a conviction said michael waddington a military defense lawyer and former judge advocate in the army he sees too many cases that involve alcohol and depend on hearsaythe military has the resources to take many sexual assault cases to court said philip cave a military defense lawyer and retired navy lawyer waddington estimated that ninety percent of the sexual assault cases taken to courtmartial would be thrown out in a civilian court because of a lack of evidenceas a result the military are now trying various other different initiatives to try and cope with a problem which to have spun out of controlrt international reports promoting empathy and cracking down on hypermasculinity may help the department of defense to reduce unwanted sexual behavior and improve combat readiness a new government report on sexual violence in the military saysunwanted sexual behaviors such as sexual harassment sexual assault and domestic violence undermine core values unit cohesion combat readiness and public goodwill says the report published this month by the government accountability office gao and signed by brenda farrell director of defense capabilities and managementthe report pointed out that interconnected inappropriate behaviors are part of a continuum of harm that creates a climate conducive to sexual harassment assault and violence the national defense authorization act ndaa for fiscal year 2017 expanded the definition of sexual harassment in the military beyond sex discrimination to make it an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault both the pentagon and the separate service branches have yet to update their policies to reflect this new definition the gao foundthe report also urged the pentagon to incorporate the guidelines for preventing and dealing with sexual violence developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdcthe pentagon is ignoring risk factors identified by the cdc such as alcohol and drug use hypermasculinity emotionally unsupportive family environments general tolerance of sexual violence within the community and societal norms that support male superiority and sexual entitlement the report saysnewport ri oct 29 2010 gunnery sgt duncan hurst encourages an officer candidate to properly perform pushups during the first week of the 12week officer candidate school at naval station newport hurst is one of 12 marine drill instructors who train the candidates in military bearing discipline drill

actions affect others cdc s research has also established that survivors of one form of violence are more likely to be victims of other forms of violence that survivors of violence are at higher risk for behaving violently and that people who behave violently are more likely to commit other forms of violence the gao report notes apparently seeking to make a distinction between violence in authorized military conflict and personal violencenoting that the dod instructed the services in 2014 to develop mechanisms for reporting incidents of sexual harassment anonymously the gao said that such mechanisms are not yet part of the departmentwide sexual violence policiesadditionally each service branch uses a different database format to record formal complaints of sexual harassment the navy uses excel spreadsheets for example while the gao does not go as far as to recommend a single database the report does advocate improving and standardizing data collection so that the department of defense can further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted sexual behaviors having a single standard across service branches would also be helpful the gao report says noting that the us marine corps usmc updated its standards of conduct in may the usmc made the change in response to the marines united scandal where current and former members posted nude photos of female recruits in a facebook group along with disparaging comments while the marines now consider posting nude photos of others without consent to be harassment other service branches do not as of yetthe

The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil, dr can erimtan 21st century wiredid donald j trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world did he have any idea that the whole wide world including the united nations would turn against himon wednesday 6 december 2017 in the white house s diplomatic reception room the president of the united states proceeded to make history or proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise they failed to deliver today i am delivering in his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement trump explained that in 1995 under bill clinton s watch that is congress adopted the jerusalem embassy act urging the federal government to relocate the american embassy to jerusalem and to recognize that that city and so importantly is israel s capital this act passed congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the senate only six months ago in this way the 45th us president showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed as he uttered words that neither bill clinton nor george w bush or more importantly perhaps barack obama had dared speakyes trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name in spite of the vehemently proisrael stance taken by the us ever since the time of president eisenhower 195361 and particularly ever since the six day war 510 june 1967 in spite of the ceaseless activities of aipac and j street no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide us embassy to jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the new world and the promised land only donald j trump had the gall to deliver doing what clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise    until now that isin true aristotelian fashion trump took the potentiality that was jerusalem known as al quds or the sacred city in the muslim world and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city following these presidential words outspoken israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the white house mark regev the erstwhile spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs in jerusalem 20047 and frequent israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media and currently even active as israeli ambassador in london since 2015 blurted out that he thinks this was a just move and a good move for peace his boss bibi or benjamin netanyahu fourth premiership 2015 present was equally forthcoming talking to the press on the same day the us president made his performance in the diplomatic reception room thank you president trump for today s historic decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital the jewish people and the jewish state will be forever grateful the pm in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words declaring that there is no peace that doesn t include jerusalem as the capital of israel the idea that jerusalem should be at the heart of the jewish people s land and nation namely has its roots in the bible in 2 chronicles 656 to be precise since the day i brought my people out of egypt i have not chosen a city in any tribe of israel to have a temple built so that my name might be there nor have i chosen anyone to be ruler over my people israel but now i have chosen jerusalem for my name to be there and i have chosen david to rule my people israel as worded in the new international version and bibi knows that toobibi even took his words of praise abroad first to paris where he met with president emmanuel macron who had urged his us counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to trump s diplomatic reception room performance 10 december 2017 bibi disagreed volubly with the frenchman characterising as absurd anyone not willing to recognise the millennial connection of the jewish people to jerusalem next even proceeding to refer to god s word that had elevated jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple you can read it in a very fine book it s called the bible the following day he went to brussels where he attended a meeting of eu foreign ministers 11 december 2017 the israeli pm told the gathered eu fm as well as the assembled press corps that trump s jerusalem declaration makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace the foundation of peace the invention of the jewish people and the position of jerusalem in islamthe state of israel as a jewish nation state implanted on middle eastern soil in 1948 employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence the israeli journalist and author daniel gavron for example states that most israelis regard it as axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3000th anniversary of the conquest of jerusalem by king david in 1995 marked a real and tangible event even though he himself doubts its authenticity in other words the jewish people as a shorthand for the israeli citzenry have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by bibi for quite a while but as i explained at length some time ago the mere mention of the term nation or even just people is a problematic issue in its own right the point that i am trying to get across is that nations or people cannot be perceived as natural or even organic phenomena but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger artificial whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures leaders of men and their organisations it has been nearly ten years now that the historian schlomo sand published his groundbreaking text the invention of the jewish people which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like benedict anderson and ernst gellner amongst others but as seems blatantly apparent from looking at bibi s recent proclamations his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble in spite of having topped israeli bestseller list for nineteen weeks with regard to the city of jerusalem on the other hand archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the site has been continuously occupied for some 5000 years signalling the urban centre s prejewish roots but the notion that king david conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky gavron explains that the biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have and in the opinion of most modern scholars the bible is not an entirely reliable historical document still archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain david indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century bce namely a small triangular piece of basalt rock    subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of syria and later smashed by an israelite ruler carrying an aramaic inscription talking about a beit david  house or dynasty of david  but the jewish conquest of jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover andor occupation remaining in ancient times the assyrian king sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 bce whereas the babylonian nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign 598 bce but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of titus son of the roman emperor vespasian 70 ce in response to the jews great revolt against rome that had sprung up in 66 ce the ultimate outcome of rome s harsh response was the diaspora as explained by the american rabbi lecturer and author joseph telushkin who estimates that as many as one million jews died as a result while carrying in its wake the almost twothousandyear span of jewish homelessness and exile with the majority of jews apparently dispersed from the land and city jerusalem was eventually conquered by the caliph umar reign 63444 in the year 638 an event which seems to have taken place following a peaceful siege no blood was shed in the words of zia h shah a new yorkbased physician and the chief editor of the muslim times the addition of jerusalem to the dar alislam or the abode of islam was important though the city s name does not appear specifically in the quran containing only a reference to almasjid al aqsa or the furthest mosque 171 it is the locus of the prophet s miraculous night journey or mi raj the story as related in various prophetic traditions or hadith tells how the figure of the prophet travelled from makkah to the furthest mosque in jerusalem from whence he ascended heaven so that allah might show him of our signs as a result the masjid al aqsa arguably built by the caliph umar though no historical records exist to this effect is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in islam following the masjid alharam in makkah and al masjid annabawi in madinaha pseudoottoman gambit diverting attention for a purposeas a result donald trump s diplomatic reception room stunt far supersedes the thorny palestinian issue the lifeanddeath matter of peace in the middle east or even the real estate division between east and west jerusalem the englishlanguage panarab television channel al jazeera english matteroffactly point out on its website that violence protests and arrests have followed us president donald trump s decision to recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel all across the globe muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of trump s latest attempt to act like a real president a president unlike any of his predecessors rallies against trump s decision also took place in the indian city of mumbai the malaysian capital kuala lumpur and the japanese capital tokyo but also in turkey where president recept tayyip erdo an aka the prez has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the ottoman sultans of old after all sultan selim i 151220 took hold of the city of jerusalem in 1517 remaining part of the ottoman fold till the onset of the british mandate 191748 on thursday and friday 78 december 2017 spontaneous meetings took place throughout the whole of the country from istanbul over bursa ankara and mersin to hatay gaziantep tatvan adana van and kahramanmara  more importantly the 57member organisation of islamic cooperation oic held a meeting in istanbul on 13 december 2017 and the prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of islam defying not just the united states of america and israel but also the kingdom of saudi arabia the nominal custodian of the two holy mosques as i have written quite some time ago the prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally king salman and see himself as the rightful calip of the world of islam in true pseudoottoman fashionthe oic meeting dutifully released its istanbul declaration on freedom for al quds  appreciating the republic of turkey and the turkish people for hosting the extraordinary islamic summit regarding this important cause of ummah especially the call for this extraordinary summit made by his excellency recep tayyip erdo an image left president of the republic of turkey    we reject and condemn the us administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of al quds    just like the fact that israel s decision to annex al quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience justice and history we invite all members of the un the eu and the international community to remain committed to the status of al quds and all related un resolutions rather than accomplishing anything much at all the extraordinary oic meeting primarily served to heighten tayyip erdo an s prestige at home as well as abroad as such a cynic would say that trump s timing was impeccable as 1725 december marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as akpgate that erupted in 2013 and that presently was very much on people s minds in turkey given that the turkishiranian businessman reza zarrab or r za sarraf in turkish was appearing in court in new york the court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon iran and many turks eagerly followed the proceedings on twitter one istanbulbased writer kareem shaheen described the accusations as follows in a case that has strained relations between turkey and the us reza zarrab a turkishiranian gold trader described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme he told jurors in new york on thursday 30 november 2017 that tayyip erdo an who was prime minister of turkey at the time had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of iran zarrab said he had also bribed the then turkish economy minister zafer a layan and the former head of the stateowned halkbank as a result given that the zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire turcoamerican relationship trump s jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for erdogan the decision to recognise jerusalem as israel s capital finally absolved the erdogan from any attempts to salvage the crossatlantic relationship and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the republic of turkey is now the rightful heir to the ottoman empire and the only hope left for muslims across the world muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive us foreign policy and putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent erdo an announced on thursday 17 december 2017 that he would establish a turkish embassy in jerusalem representing ankara in palestine to be clear speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of karaman the prez declared god willing the day is close when officially with god s permission we will open our embassy there in jerusalemall the while the palestinian people continue to suffer and israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the gaza strip and crack down on palestinian protesters but trump has done his deed leaving his indelible mark on the middle east while the prez in turn

Bundy Case Ruled a Mistrial – Will Federal Case Soon Crumble?,mark anderson 21st century wirethe greek philosopher plato was credited with saying justice in the life and conduct of the state is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens well since longtime nevada rancher cliven bundy his sons and his other compatriots have demonstrated they possess a strong sense of principles and justice perhaps a little justice in the life of the american state is possible which is no small thing in an age of nearly universal tyranny and injusticethis welcome ray of light became apparent in las vegas on dec 20 when us district judge gloria navarro declared a mistrial in the current highprofile proceedings involving cliven his sons ryan and ammon and ryan paynethis prompted members of the bundy family and dozens of their supporters to leave the courthouse on that tuesday in a state of elation even with the presence of protesters who holding signs that read keep your bundy hands off public lands appeared to be paid agitators for billionaire leftist revolutionary george soros as one protestor basically admittedback in the spring of 2014 the abovenamed four defendants who ve become emblematic of the plight of western ranchers resisting heavyhanded federal land controls were accompanied by other bundy siblings and by scores of supporters from across the nation all of whom gathered near cliven s ranch in clark county in southern nevada to exercise their first and second amendment rightson that basis these brave souls some of whom were armed in an opencarry state protested the actions of wellarmed bureau of land management agents fbi agents including swat units and contractors when these officials showed up set up shop and finally moved to impound cliven s cattle over flimsy allegations of unpaid grazing fees on public lands the impoundment attempt on april 12 2014 was unsuccessful howeverbut while the government retreated that day after a lengthy and often tense standoff a 16count federal indictment was eventually handed down cliven ammon and the two ryans were among nearly 20 initially indicted in this nowlegendary federal case which hasn t gone particularly well for prosecutors ever since the first of several planned trials started in february of 2017thus the government despite spending millions of dollars has seen its case steadily deflate to the point where as of now the only things that remain according to a legal observer are for judge navarro to receive briefs from the prosecution and the defense by 5 pm dec 29 when a hearing may take place those briefs will consist of arguments to enable the judge to decide whether or not to fully dismiss the casethe mistrial happened around 930 am pacific time dec 20 as navarro told the jury to go home    it s over recounted roger roots a legal expert and author who has observed virtually every trial proceeding firsthandhe said that after judge navarro reviews the briefs an open hearing will be convened at 9 am on jan 8 according to the court schedule as of this writing if she rules for dismissal jan 8 without prejudice the indictment remains in force and federal prosecutors technically could reset the trial of cliven and the three others reportedly on or around feb 26 but if she rules for dismissal with prejudice then the indictment is dissolved according to rootsroots said a dissolved indictment would mean the government would have to go to the trouble and expense of convening a new grand jury in order to seek a new indictment which would be double jeopardy and therefore a probable constitutional violationand while roots said the government conceivably could appeal the mistrial ruling to the ninth circuit at this point he does not believe the government would jump through all the necessary hoops for a new indictmentnotably what helped make the mistrial a reality was navarro s findings reached during hearings on exculpatory evidence that the government has been withholding that the prosecution had committed several brady v maryland violations including not disclosing to the defense the existence of surveillance cameras including those trained at the bundy homesteadalso included is not disclosing the fact that concealed snipers were stationed around the area at the time of the 2014 standoff not disclosing the existence of maps of the snipers positions and among other things not disclosing threatassessment reports which include government admissions that cliven and company are not dangerous peoplesee also nevada residents public land belongs to the people not dc notably family patriarch cliven as a matter of principle stayed in prison despite a recent hearing in which the court allowed him to leave jail under house arrest he has been jailed since early 2016 and has suffered from health problemscliven based his decision on the fact that a few remaining defendants which had included his sons mel and dave until they too were granted house arrest are still in jail awaiting a final trial that s been scheduled to take place sometime next year moreover ryan and ammon bundy as well as ryan payne all were recently released under housearrest rulings after an equally grueling amount of time behind barsduring a recent ontheair interview cliven s daughterinlaw briana who s mel s wife told free speech zone host jim lambley of ksdzfm the twister out of nebraska that in the almost two years that cliven has been behind bars several more grandchildren of his were born yet cliven despite such a strong emotional attachment to his large family still chose to remain in jail to honor the others still imprisonedon a dec 20 appearance on the same radio show briana added over 3300 hundred pages of evidence that could ve helped the defense have been withheld and have been turned over to the defense in the last two weeks     it was absolutely intentional and she judge navarro said she believes it was intentional because of what they withheld briana who understands that even one let alone several brady violations normally would be expected to lead to a full dismissal of the case right away rather than carrying on with more hearings added however that the bundy siblings all are wearing electronic ankle bracelets and cannot leave their housearrest locations before 7 am and must return by 7 pm even while they are prohibited from congregating during christmastime but we re still winning here briana went on to tell ksdz host jim lambley while adding that even though a dismissal was hopedfor rather than a mistrial the upside is that any further proceedings will provide an opportunity to expose even more evidence that the government has withheldlambley replied the government is just digging a deeper hole for themselves the government is the false accuser here that s all there is to it mr roots who s cautiously optimistic about the remainder of this case said that given the mistrial ruling the few defendants still behind bars have a dramatically improved chance of never going to trial cliven won t go home until this case is all the way over roots remarked moved by cliven

"Trump Team Didn’t Just Collude with Israel, Kushner was Acting as Foreign Agent for Tel Aviv",patrick henningsen 21st century wiremuch was made this week in the us media about michael flynn s recent guilty plea to making false statements to the fbi as part of special counsel robert mueller s neverending russia probe beyond the political window dressing however there s a much bigger and more profound story lingering in the background although court documents show flynn has admitted to giving false statements in reference to his reaching out to russia s ambassador to the us sergey kislyak the mere act of initiating contact with any foreign official is neither illegal nor is it a violation of ethics putting the current red scare aside this would normally be viewed as standard statecraft for members of any incoming us administration even if flynn had promised the russian ambassador as claimed this week by resistance leader rep elijah e cummings of maryland that a trump government would ripup sanctions such a promise by flynn would not be unlawful anyone can make a promise we should point out here that neither flynn nor donald trump would be in any position to make good on such a promise without the blessing of the us congress and senate just look at what happened when trump took office were any sanctions liftedthat said after 18 months of fabricating fake news about russian hacking russian meddling and russian collusion it s not surprising that the new york times would get the flynn story wrong too and on an even bigger scale than many of their past madeup stories about trump scandals here we have yet another handwringing resistance writer harry litman claiming that flynn s testimony will go down in history next to watergate and irancontra the repercussions of the plea will be months in the making but it s not an exaggeration to say that the events to which mr flynn has agreed to testify will take their place in the history books alongside the watergate and irancontra scandals he might be right if only the media coverage and the federal hearing would focus on the correct country with whom the trump team was colluding which unfortunately was not russia funny how partisan writer litman did not even mention the word israel once in his report perhaps this is why certain persons in washington like adam schiff chuck schumer john mccain and others along with their corrupt media counterparts like cnn the washington post and the new york times have been incessantly pushing their fictional russia did it narrative for the last 18 months because russiagate serves as a convenient overlay for israelgatemehdi hassan from the intercept writes why aren t more members of congress or the media discussing the trump transition team s pretty brazen collusion with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to undermine both us government policy and international law shouldn t that be treated as a major scandal thanks to mueller s ongoing investigation we now know that prior to president donald trump s inauguration members of his inner circle went to bat on behalf of israel and specifically on behalf of illegal israeli settlements in the occupied palestinian territories behind the scenes and in opposition to official us foreign policy that s the kind of collusion with a foreign state that has gotten a lot of attention with respect to the kremlin but colluding with israel seems to be of far less interest strangely yes you heard that right this was at minimum collusion with israel but it goes much deeper than that if this story is accurate and we have every reason to believe it is especially by the large silence in the american media usually a positive indication of media avoidance this would indicate that the then presidentelect s close advisor and soninlaw jared kushner was clearly acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the state of israel the fact the us media are not taking this story more seriously should serve as a reminder as to how much power the israeli lobby wields in the us not just over politicians but over mainstream media as well granted this is a very serious charge which comes with some serious consequences if kushner would ever be indicted but the facts clearly demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that then presidentelect s soninlaw was using his proximity to the incoming commander and chief to execute a series of highly sensitive foreign policy maneuvers at the request of a foreign countrythe history of israeli spying and outright meddling in us affairs is no secret to anyone willing to research it unofficially a forbidden topic in us mainstream media but this latest episode with trump and kushner is even more disturbing considering this week s controversial east jerusalem announcement 21wire warned about an east jerusalem provocation 12 months agobeyond this many will argue that the radical fundamentalist zionist agenda which kushner is aggressively pursuing on behalf of tel aviv is not in the interest of the wider middle east nor is it good for america s european partners and may even contribute to a further destablization of the region as evidenced by recent violence which has erupted following trump s provocative move the result is not necessarily in america s interests even if it is certainly in israel s interestsauthor mehdi hassan continueshere s what we learned last week when mueller s team unveiled its plea deal with trump s former national security adviser retired gen michael flynn in december 2016 the united nations security council was debating a draft resolution that condemned israeli settlement expansion in the occupied territories as a flagrant violation under international law that was dangerously imperiling the viability of an independent palestinian statethe obama administration had made it clear that the us was planning to abstain on the resolution while noting that the settlements have no legal validity and observing how the settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is now putting at risk the twostate solution rhetorically at least us opposition to israeli settlements has been a longstanding and bipartisan position for decades ronald reagan called for a real settlement freeze in 1982 while george hw bush tried to curb israeli settlementbuilding plans by briefly cutting off us loan guarantees to the jewish state in 1991everyone expected that the upcoming un vote on illegal israeli settlements was going to be a divisive issue but with only weeks before trump s fast approaching inauguration israel had its trojan horse in position hassan goes on to explain tel aviv s covert mechanism for manipulating the un vote on or about december 22 2016 a very senior member of the presidential transition team directed flynn to contact officials from foreign governments including russia to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution reads the statement of offense against flynn who pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations with the russian ambassador to the us on or about december 22 2016 flynn contacted the russian ambassador about the pending vote flynn informed the russian ambassador about the incoming administration s opposition to the resolution and requested that russia vote against or delay the resolution bffs donald trump talks to his chief foreign policy advisor israeli president benjamin netanyahuso who was this very senior member of trump s team who sought to execute orders from the office of israeli president benjamin netanyahu hassan explainswho was the very senior member of the transition team who directed flynn to do all this multiple news outlets have confirmed that it was jared kushner trump s soninlaw and main point man on the middle east peace process jared called flynn and told him you need to get on the phone to every member of the security council and tell them to delay the vote a trump transition official revealed to buzzfeed news on friday adding that kushner told flynn this was a top priority for the president according to buzzfeed after hanging up flynn told the entire room at the trump transition team hq that they d have to start pushing to lobby against the un vote saying the president wants this done asap flynn s guilty plea buzzfeed continued revealed for the first time how trump transition officials solicited russia s help to head off the un vote and undermine the obama administration s policy on middle east peace before ever setting foot in the white house even during the height of the neocon era with multiple israeli loyalists in the cabinet including some dual passport holders shaping white house middle east policy ultimately into a ditch with iraq the level of manipulation wasn t this overt trump s decision to reverse successive us administrations new policy on east jerusalem is inconceivable if not for some other xfactor which the pnacdominated george w bush could not even managethe facts of the case against kushner have not been contested and in fact kushner has even been gloating out on the speaking circuit with his doting wife ivanka proudly advertizing her husband s accomplishment on behalf israelmy husband jared kushner had a great conversation on the middle east with haim saban today at the saban forum saban17httpstcobubgfd1ynr ivanka trump ivankatrump december 4 2017 none of this has been contested in fact on sunday kushner made a rare public appearance at the saban forum in washington dc to discuss the trump administration s plans for the middle east and was welcomed by the forum s sponsor the israeliamerican billionaire haim saban who said he personally wanted to thank kushner for taking steps to try and get the united nations security council to not go along with what ended up being an abstention by the us kushner s response the first soninlaw smiled nodded and mouthed thank you to sabanmeanwhile the israelis have been pretty forthcoming about their own role in all of this too on monday ron dermer israel s ambassador to the us and a close friend and ally of netanyahu told politico s susan glasser that in december 2016 obviously we reached out to the trump transition team in the hope that they would help us and we were hopeful that they would speak to other governments in order to prevent this vote from happening got that the trump transition team in the form of key trump advisers kushner and flynn reached out to the russian government in order to undermine the us government because the israeli government asked them to according to these reports kushner was using his position in the transition team to act on israel s behalf outside of any governmental framework of accountability if flynn inadvertently found himself in a russian trap it was because israel and its inhouse operative demanded itif flynn is guilty of anything it would be going along with kushner s israel first scheme ahead of the united nations vote what is odd though is why the entire us mainstream media is not interested in this part of the story even the never trump resistance seem to be afraid of taking this narrative on i guess even the resistance has its limits rather than go for a case where the evidence is sitting right there on a silver salver instead they will go for the russian conspiracy theory alas old habits die hardsee also the genealogy of trump s uturn on palestinethis series of events is all the more pertinent when considering this week s announcement by president trump that the us is to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and will be moving its embassy from tel aviv to east jerusalem many are already calling this the kiss of death to the israelpalestine peace process in a predictable succession of events the jerusalem provocation was a fait accompli after trump had announced in october that the us would be withdrawing from support for unesco the un body which is meant to help maintain the neutrality of jerusalem as an internationally protected area the trump administration justified its resignation from the key un agency on the grounds that it is biased against israel but the neutrality of jerusalem is an essential policy for maintaining peace in a less than ideal situation with palestine still under a brutal military occupation by an illegitimate and illegal by international law and successive un resolutions israeli jackbootin addition to all this this past summer the united states announced the establishment of a permanent military installation inside of israel what s scary is how many people do not know this has happenedso trump s minence grise the wunderkind who some people have called the president inlaw is really israel s man inside the white houselanded on his feet president inlaw jared kushnerso what exactly are jared kushner s credentials in international relations and diplomacy that he has been charged with negotiating middle east affairs for the united states of america without sounding too cruel here it s difficult to find anything to say in his defense in the end his only visible qualification is that he s married to the president s daughter and that s he s a good friend of netanyahu that s really itcredit where credit s due though aside from marrying into the dynasty kushner is also the former owner of a mediocre website the new york observer and has also managed to parlay his family status to help finance a number of highprofile new york city property deals with foreign buyers no doubt with the help of his fatherinlawisn t that what kushner is doing right now using his inherited clout to help close friend benjamin netanyahu broker property deals highly illegal by international law in the middle east only this time with his uncle sam acting as the guarantor it certainly looks that way the question is will anyone in the us do anything about itwhen this latest episode of hubris by the white house and israel eventually unravels the public and the media might then turn on kushner and trump but by then the damage will have already been donemeanwhile men like jake tapper and wolf blitzer will still be chasing those illusive russian hackers clear into the 2020 election cycle which is probably a stupid move for the resistance but if the last 18 months have taught us anything it s that there isn t much clear thinking going on in that corner of the galaxyuntil then netanyahu can feel safe in the knowledge that israel not washington is currently in control

US Thanksgiving Guide: How to Celebrate a Sordid and Genocidal History, table set for thanksgiving in siem reap photo andre vltchekandre vltchek neoa table was set up for two an advertisement table a table with a photo of a giant turkey two elegant plates and a us flag sticking out into the air thanksgiving at angkor royal cafe  a flier read and 23rd november join us for a traditional thanksgiving feast this was at one of the international hotels in siem reap a cambodian city near the world architectural treasures of angkor wat and the ancient khmer capital angkor thomthe same day i read an email sent to me from the united states by my native american friends with a link to an essay published by mpn news called thanksgiving guide how to celebrate a sordid history  it began with a summary while millions of americans prepare this week to get into the holiday spirit beginning with thanksgiving how many are prepared to view the day through an accurate lens while to many americans the holiday serves as a reminder to give thanks it is seen as a day of mourning by countless of others the truth is european migrants brutally murdered native americans stole their land and continue to do so today  the day became an official day of festivities in 1637 to celebrate the massacre of over 700 people from the pequot tribein a hotel i approached a cheerful french food and beverage manager and asked him whether he was aware of what he was suggesting should be celebrated in one of his restaurants oh i know i know he replied laughing it is a little bit controversial isn t it bit controversial i wondered it appears more like you are inviting people to celebrate genocide a holocaust with free flowing wine and a giant turkey i am trying to see things positively he continued grinning at me then he summarized so i guess you won t be joining us tonight what a pity what a pity i thought what a pity i won t get to eat that famous american pie tonight and turkey and who knows what else just because i am not eager at all to celebrate the massacres and land grabs perpetrated by the empirethe manager couldn t help asking where are you from i knew he would ask no european would say what i was saying i m russian i replied oh i see he gave me that i should have guessed smile  russianamerican i addedi m convinced that the french manager has been sincerely oblivious about what i was stating he is supposed to be oblivious there are after all our genocides  and the genocides of the others  our genocides  those that we triggered or committed should never be discussed or more precisely it is extremely impolite to discuss them most of the people don t even know about them including many of the victims on the other hand the genocides committed by the others particularly by adversaries of the west are widely discussed publicized analyzed inflated and very often even fabricated all this described in detail in my 840page book exposing lies of the empire cambodia is the textbook case of the latter here several decades ago the us and its allies first supported the hopelessly corrupt and brutal government in phnom penh while triggering a monstrous carpetbombing campaign of the cambodian countryside mainly near the border with vietnam this was supposed to prevent the country from going communist  or at least ho chi minh style communist  hundreds of thousands of villagers were murdered by the bombing millions were forced to hit the road leaving their dwellings as the countryside was converted into a giant minefield covered by unexploded ordnancefurther hundreds of thousands died from starvation and diseases furious mad from suffering the people of cambodia rose against the collaborators with the west in phnom penh pol pot and his khmer rouge took the capital virtually unopposed recently deep in the jungle i spoke to the former pol pot s personal guards i asked them pointblank whether they knew anything about communism nothing at all i was told the us was murdering our families for no reason corrupt elites were selling the country to the west we were all outraged and ready for revenge we would follow anybody calling for revenge however the west is passing the events to this day as a communist genocide rwanda is yet another case of a twisted narrative i made an entire fulllength documentary film rwanda gambit on the subject there the west turned the history upside down reducing the entire tragedy into a primitive and easytodigest narrative of bad hutus killing good tutsis yet even the former us ambassador robert flatten told me that his country groomed armed and supported the deadly rpf mainly tutsi army which had been before 1994 raiding the rwandan countryside from neighboring uganda burning villages and killing civilianswhile a former australian lawyer and un investigator michael hourigan supplied me with information about the downing of the plane which in april 1994 killed both the rwandan president juvenal habyarimana and burundian president cyprien ntaryamira while on the final approach to kigali airport the orders to shoot down the plane were given by the rpf leader paul kagame who was in turn sponsored by the west this event triggered the terrible bloodletting on 1994 the next year in 1995 the rwandan army entered the democratic republic of congo drc and participated in the killing of at least 9 million people mainly civilians on behalf of western governments and multinational companies making it the worst crime against humanity in recent historyin fact almost all the major genocides committed by the west or its allies in modern history are silent ones  including those in iraq syria iran west papua east timor drc indonesia afghanistan angola and dozens of other unfortunate places all over the worldthe gruesome genocides committed by the west all over the world during the last 2000 but especially during the last 500 years are never defined as such never as genocides  throughout history european countries have been destroying systematically most of the cultures on all continents of the planet enslaving virtually all the nonwhite nations plundering and looting its colonies read almost all the nonwhite nations of the world while exterminating hundreds of millions of men women and children the death toll has been rising accumulating to near 1 billion according to the testimony of one of my friends a senior un statisticiani will return to the cambodian story soon on the pages of this magazine and i will be returning again and again to the genocides committed by europe and north america virtually everywhere unless the history is understood and acknowledged the world has no future and there can be no solutions to the terrible problems that our humanity is facingbut for now let me conclude this brief essay by saying that i did not participate in the consumption of turkey and american pies on thanksgiving holiday in the cambodian city of seam reapmy thoughts went to those 700 people from the pequot tribe who rebelled stood firm and died for freedom almost 400 years ago these were some of the first fighters against western imperialism these were the americans that i admire this is america that had been terribly damaged but not yet completely destroyed no overly sugary sentimental and empty words could fully choke its essence as no gluttony

Repeat Deceit: How US Tries to Link Iran to Al Qaeda,when it comes to interpreting current events no one does official conspiracy theories like the unite statesfor years washington has tried to promulgate a propaganda campaign which tries to somehow link al qaeda to iran or isis to iran for the mentallychallenged members of the rightwing media in the us this isn t a massive feat as a large segment of that audience cannot even locate iran on a global map there is also the issue of us warhawks like lindsey graham and john mccain being proven pathological liars who will say anything regardless of whether it s based in actual fact all of this contributes to a number of shallow creative narratives which continuously circulate between fox news the atlantic magazine tel aviv riyadh and the us senateand just like the us and uk mainstream media s coverage of syria the deep throat source in this dossier is al qaedathis latest chapter in the us fantasy world of iranian intrigue attempts to further the israelifavoured mythology blaming iran for all of the region s woes make no mistake the american neoconservative wing and their israeli benefactors are determined to invent new conditions for war with iran image bush s al qaeda no2 guy abu musab al zarqawigareth porter the american conservative for many years major us institutions ranging from the pentagon to the 911 commission have been pushing the line that iran secretly cooperated with al qaeda both before and after the 911 terror attacks but the evidence for those claims remained either secret or sketchy and always highly questionablein early november however the mainstream media claimed to have its smoking gun a cia document written by an unidentified al qaeda official and released in conjunction with 47000 neverbeforeseen documents seized from osama bin laden s house in abbottabad pakistanthe associated press reported that the al qaeda document appears to bolster us claims that iran supported the extremist network leading up to the september 11 terror attacks the wall street journal said the document provides new insights into al qaeda s relationship with iran suggesting a pragmatic alliance that emerged out of shared hatred of the united states and saudi arabia nbc news wrote that the document reveals that at various points in the relationship iran offered al qaeda help in the form of money arms and training in hezbollah camps in lebanon in exchange for striking american interests in the gulf implying that al qaeda had declined the offerformer obama national security council spokesman ned price writing for the atlantic went even further asserting that the document includes an account of a deal with iranian authorities to host and train saudial qaeda members as long as they have agreed to plot against their common enemy american interests in the gulf region but none of those media reports were based on any careful reading of the document s contents the 19page arabiclanguage document which was translated in full for the american conservative doesn t support the media narrative of new evidence of iranal qaeda cooperation either before or after 911 at allit provides no evidence whatsoever of tangible iranian assistance to al qaeda on the contrary it confirms previous evidence that iranian authorities quickly rounded up those al qaeda operatives living in the country when they were able to track them down and held them in isolation to prevent any further contact with al qaeda units outside irantaken by surprisewhat it shows is that the al qaeda operatives were led to believe iran was friendly to their cause and were quite taken by surprise when their people were arrested in two waves in late 2002 it suggests that iran had played them gaining the fighters trust while maximizing intelligence regarding al qaeda s presence in irannevertheless this account which appears to have been written by a midlevel al qaeda cadre in 2007 appears to bolster an internal al qaeda narrative that the terror group rejected iranian blandishments and were wary of what they saw as untrustworthiness on the part of the iranians the author asserts the iranians offered saudi al qaeda members who had entered the country money and arms anything they need and training with hezbollah in exchange for hitting american interests in saudi arabia and the gulf but there is no word about whether any iranian arms or money were ever actually given to al qaeda fighters and the author acknowledges that the saudis in question were among those who had been deported during sweeping arrests casting doubt over whether there was ever any deal in the offingthe author suggests al qaeda rejected iranian assistance on principle we don t need them he insisted thanks to god we can do without them and nothing can come from them but evil that theme is obviously important to maintaining organizational identity and morale but later in the document the author expresses deep bitterness about what they obviously felt was iranian doubledealing in 2002 to 2003 they are ready to playact he writes of the iranians their religion is lies and keeping quiet and usually they show what is contrary to what is in their mind  it is hereditary with them deep in their character the author recalls that al qaeda operatives were ordered to move to iran in march 2002 three months after they had left afghanistan for waziristan or elsewhere in pakistan the document by the way says nothing of any activity in iran before 911 he acknowledges that most of his cadres entered iran illegally although some of them obtained visas from the iranian consulate in karachiamong the latter was abu hafs al mauritani an islamic scholar who was ordered by the leadership shura in pakistan to seek iranian permission for al qaeda fighters and families to pass through iran or to stay there for an extended period he was accompanied by middle and lowerranking cadres including some who worked for abu musab al zarqawi the account clearly suggests that zarqawi himself had remained in hiding after entering iran illegallystrict conditionsabu hafs al mauratani did reach an understanding with iran according to the al qaeda account but it had nothing to do with providing arms or money it was a deal that allowed them to remain for some period or to pass through the country but only on the condition that they observe very strict security conditions no meetings no use of cell phones no movements that would attract attention the account attributes those restrictions to iranian fears of us retribution which was undoubtedly part of the motivation but it is clear iran viewed al qaeda as an extremist salafist security threat to itself as wellmost of the al qaeda visitors according to the al qaeda document settled in zahedan the capital of sistan and baluchistan province where the majority of the population are sunnis and speak baluchi they generally violated the security restrictions imposed by the iranians they established links with the baluchis who he notes were also salafists and began holding meetings some of them even made direct contact by phone with salafist militants in chechnya where a conflict was rapidly spiraling out of control saif aladel one of the leading al qaeda figures in iran at the time later revealed that the al qaeda fighting contingent under abu musab al zarqawi s command immediately began reorganizing to return to afghanistanwaves of arreststhe first iranian campaign to round up al qaeda personnel which the author of the documents says was focused on zahedan came in may or june 2002 no more than three months after they have had entered iran those arrested were either jailed or deported to their home countries the saudi foreign minister praised iran in august for having transferred 16 al qaeda suspects to the saudi government in junein february 2003 iranian security launched a new wave of arrests this time they captured three major groups of al qaeda operatives in tehran and mashad including zarqawi and other top leaders in the country according to the document saif al adel later revealed in a post on a proal qaeda website in 2005 reported in the saudiowned newspaper asharq alawsat that the iranians had succeeded in capturing 80 percent of the group associated with zarqawi and that it had caused the failure of 75 percent of our plan the anonymous author writes that the initial iran policy was to deport those arrested and that zarqawi was allowed to go to iraq where he plotted attacks on shia and coalition forces until his death in 2006 but then he says the policy suddenly changed and the iranians stopped deportations instead opting to keep the al qaeda senior leadership in custody presumably as bargaining chips yes iran deported 225 al qaeda suspects to other countries including saudi arabia in 2003 but the al qaeda leaders were held in iran not as bargaining chips but under tight security to prevent them from communicating with the al qaeda networks elsewhere in the region which bush administration officials eventually acknowledgedafter the arrests and imprisonment of senior al qaeda figures the al qaeda leadership became increasingly angry at iran in november 2008 unknown gunmen abducted an iran consular official in peshawar pakistan and in july 2013 al qaeda operatives in yemen kidnapped an iranian diplomat in march 2015 iran reportedly released five of the senior al qaeda in prison including said aladel in return for the release of the diplomat in yemenin a document taken from the abbottabad compound and published by west point s counterterrorism center in 2012 a senior al qaeda official wrote we believe that our efforts which included escalating a political and media campaign the threats we made the kidnapping of their friend the commercial counselor in the iranian consulate in peshawar and other reasons that scared them based on what they saw we are capable of to be among the reasons that led them to expedite the release of these prisoners there was a time when iran did view al qaeda as an ally it was during and immediately after the war of the mujahedin against soviet troops in afghanistan that of course was the period when the cia was backing bin laden s efforts as well but after the taliban seized power in kabul in 1996 and especially after taliban troops killed 11 iranian diplomats in mazarisharif in 1998 the iranian view of al qaeda changed fundamentally since then iran has clearly regarded it as an extreme sectarian terrorist organization and its sworn enemy what has not changed is the determination of the us national security state and the supporters of israel to maintain the myth of an enduring iranian support

History Lesson: America’s Renegade Warfare,nicolas j s davies consortium newsseventyseven million people in north and south korea find themselves directly in the line of fire from the threat of a second korean war the rest of the world is recoiling in horror from the scale of civilian casualties such a war would cause and the unthinkable prospect that either side might actually use nuclear weaponssince the first korean war killed at least 20 percent of north korea s population and left the country in ruins the us has repeatedly failed to follow through on diplomacy to establish a lasting peace in korea and has instead kept reverting to illegal and terrifying threats of war most significantly the us has waged a relentless propaganda campaign to discount north korea s legitimate defense concerns as it confronts the threat of a us war machine that has only grown more dangerous since the last time it destroyed north koreathe north has lived under this threat for 65 years and has watched iraq and libya destroyed after they gave up their nuclear weapons programs when north korea discovered a us plan for a second korean war on south korea s military computer network in september 2016 its leaders quite rationally concluded that a viable nuclear deterrent is the only way to guarantee their country s safetywhat does it say about the role the us is playing in the world that the only way north korea s leaders believe they can keep their own people safe is to develop weapons that could kill millions of americansthe changing face of warthe second world war was the deadliest war ever fought with at least 75 million people killed about five times as many as in the first world war when the slaughter ended in 1945 world leaders signed the united nations charter to try to ensure that that scale of mass killing and destruction would never happen again the un charter is still in force and it explicitly prohibits the threat or use of military force by any nationit was not just the scale of the slaughter that shocked the world s leaders into that brief moment of sanity in 1945 it was also the identities of the dead twothirds of the people killed in the second world war were civilians a drastic change from the first world war only a few decades earlier when an estimated 86 percent of the people killed were uniformed combatants the use of nuclear weapons by the united states raised the specter that future wars could kill an exponentially greater numbers of civilians or even end human civilization altogetherwar had become total war no longer fought only on battlefields between soldiers but between entire societies with ordinary people their homes and their lives now on the front line in the second world war fleets of warplanes deliberately bombed cities to dehouse civilian populations as british officials described their own bombing of germany as i write this george orwell wrote from london in 1941 highly civilized human beings are flying overhead trying to kill me submarines sank hundreds of merchant ships in an effort to starve their enemies into submission general carter clarke who was in charge of interpreting japanese intelligence for president truman said in a 1959 interview that japan surrendered because it faced mass starvation due to the sinking of its merchant shipping not because of the gratuitous us nuclear attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki it was estimated that 7 million more civilians would die of starvation if japan fought on until 1946 genocidal mass extermination campaigns killed civilians based only on their political affiliation or ethnicity under crossexamination by a young american prosecutor benjamin ferencz ss gruppenfuhrer dr otto ohlendorf explained patiently to a courtroom in nuremberg why he found it necessary for the preemptive defense of germany to order the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians he explained that even children had to be killed to prevent them too becoming enemies of germany when they grew up and found out what happened to their parentsdespite the un charter and international efforts to prevent war people in countries afflicted by war today still face the kind of total war that horrified world leaders in 1945 the main victims of total war in our modern world have been civilians in countries far removed from the safe havens of power and privilege where their fates are debated and decided yugoslavia afghanistan iraq somalia pakistan yemen libya syria ukraine there has been no legal or political accountability for the mass destruction of their cities their homes or their lives total war has not been prevented or even punished just externalizedbut thanks to billions of dollars invested in military propaganda and public relations and the corrupt nature of forprofit media systems citizens of the countries responsible for the killing of millions of their fellow human beings live in neartotal ignorance of the mass killing carried out in their name in these red zones around the worldpeople in everspreading war zones are living under the very conditions of total war that the world recoiled from at the end of the second world war like orwell in london in 1941 they hear highly civilized human beings flying overhead trying to kill them human beings who know nothing about them beyond the name of the city where they live and its strategic value in wars that offer them the victims nothing but death or destitutionin the case of drones the human beings trying to kill them from the other side of the world are so highly civilized that they can hop into cars and drive home to have dinner with their families at the end of their shifts while another team member efficiently takes over the joystick and carries on killingpeople in yemen syria iraq and libya have been subjected to hunger and starvation under sieges and naval blockades that are as brutally effective as german and american submarines were in world war two millions

"TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTER: Years Before ‘Soft Target’ Attack, Gunman Tried to Carry Out Death Threats on CIA Linked Air Force Base",shawn helton 21st century wire the gunman named in a mass shooting that was said to have killed 26 people at a small church outside of san antonio was convicted by the military several years before the tragic attack in 2012 this past week new information concerning the apparent first baptist church gunman 26yearold devin patrick kelley revealed that the previously convicted air force airman was already wellknown to authorities via his bad conduct discharge from the military in 2012 the recent acknowledgement in kelley s case history coupled with his unusually relaxed plea bargain deal has only prompted more questions from those concerned about the most recent highprofile mass shooting in americaaccording to officials the sutherland springs shooting at the first baptist church may have been caused by a domestic dispute involving kelley and his exmotherinlaw michelle shields however it turns out that shields was not present at church services on the morning of the mass shooting although her mother was named as one of the victimsa more precise motive in the deadly sutherland springs massacre has yet to be uncovered by authorities texas church shooting 8 years after the fort hood mass shooting the first baptist church attack raises big questions its also worth noting the recent church shooting echoes a scene in the 2015 hollywood film kingsman the secret service photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonthe texas church shooterwhile many in media have focused on the military s inability to log devin patrick kelley s domestic violence courtmartial case into a federal database a police report from 2012 revealed that the gunman named in the first baptist church shooting had been previously caught attempting to sneak firearms onto a cia linked military base in new mexico where he was stationed the el paso police report concluded that after kelley escaped the mental health facility believed to be peak behavioral health services center in santa teresa he sought to carry out death threats against his superiors at new mexico s holloman air force basea cbs affiliate from dallas further explained the church shooter s lengthy criminal background the information was contained in a police incident report after devin patrick kelley briefly escaped in june 2012 from a mental health facility in new mexico where he had been committed kprc television in houston first reported about the escape police in el paso texas where kelley was caught after the escape said in the report that an official of the mental health facility told them that kelley was a danger to himself and others the report says that kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms onto holloman air force base it also says that he was attempting to carry out death threats that kelley had made on his military chain of command moreover a fox news report just days ago revealed additional information concerning kelley s violent threats at holloman air force base former air force staff sgt jessika edwards told the new york times that kelley would shake with rage and vow to kill his superiors when he was assigned menial tasks as punishment for poor performance at one point edwards told the times she warned others in the squadron to go easy on kelley believing he was likely to come back and shoot up the place rather strangely former air force staff sgt edwards still kept in close contact with the criminally convicted and discharged logistical readiness airman stating that he asked her to be a job reference in 2015 shortly there after kelley allegedly became obsessed with the polarizing case involving charleston church shooter dylann roof church shooter what is the real motive in the first baptist church shooting image source nbcwashingtonthe shocking claims of death threats prior to the sutherland springs church shooting taking place raises questions not only about the criminally convicted shooter kelley who was accused of a slew of abusive behavior but also the military s handling of the gunman s wellknown history of violence from a prosecutorial standpointquestion how did kelley manage to get such a relaxed sentence considering he had several other major charges dropped including an additional incident where he allegedly pointed a loaded firearm at his wifefurthermore as the public and media are still bewildered over kelley s ability to legally purchase guns following his 2012 military conviction due to his prior violent abuse information concerning his alleged plot to kill military superiors has been completely underreported and by the looks of it may have even gone unpunishedaccording to official reports kelley was sentenced to a year s confinement reducing rank from an airman firstclass a1c to airman basic additionally after being convicted of crimes by a military court in 2012 he received a bad conduct discharge following an apparent plea dealthe ny times added the following details regarding the military court case prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with mr kelley including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wifehe was ultimately sentenced in november that year to 12 months confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank his final duty title was prisoner question did kelley s plea agreement also include the exclusion of charges concerning his alleged death threat plot against military superiors at the cia linked holloman air force basemoreover if that wasn t a part of the plea how was kelley not dishonorably discharged due to the severity of charges he faced from military superiorsalthough we ve been told this latest soft target shooting spree on american soil was carried out by yet another lone gunman there have also been questions raised concerning a shooter allegedly firing from the roof top down on to church parishioners belowwatch and listen to shooting survivor rosanne solis as she recounts what she witnessed during the first baptist church shooting  question is it also possible that solis saw multiple shooters at the first baptist church if not how did kelley swiftly move from the roof top location to ground level in a matter of a few minutes assuming the account told by solis is truethe sutherland springs mass shooting along with other highprofile active shooter incidents this year and year s past have once again predictably sparked sociopolitical hot button issues concerning gun reform background checks mental illness and ssri prescription drugs this is something that has prompted critics to consider that there might be even more to the storybelow is a cnn video report discussing the lengthy criminal background of the first baptist church gunman note the strong emphasis in this report regarding kelley s access to weaponry rather than a deeper analysis over how he received such a relaxed military conviction drills dupes  informantsa day after the suspicious san bernardino shooting in 2015 san antonio s nonprofit alamo community group began practicing active shooter scenarios with employees san antonio is only 35 miles from where the sutherland springs mass shooting took place and a city that has been rigorously training for mass casualty scenarios for the last five years holding active shooter drills with approximately one hundred officers a week over at least the last couple of years here s a passage from an abc affiliate in san antonio on the matter though it the training is simulated for active shooting scenarios the training could easily be applied to many other mass casualty situations as well in past two years about 4000 people have been involved in san antonio s new rescue task force training program as 21 wire has documented over the years many socalled shootingterrorattacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place a place where a lone wolf graduates into the ranks of a known wolf although the military wasn t officially keeping kelley under watch his case profile does exhibit potential signs of a possible informant status due to the litany of charges he managed to avoid through a cushy plea deal with the military historically government operators have often made use of lowlife criminals and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various roles in entrapment stings or sometimes as bona fide solo actors in an actual attacks links between security agencies military facilities and alleged attackers with a criminal history should arouse suspicion if they become connected to any future crimesin january of 2015 a strategic security service thinktank known as the soufan group reported that a larger national security threat resides with those who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies the soufan group a new york think tank said a better term for lone wolves would be known wolves  given how many are already known to western intelligence agencies before they strike these individuals acting alone or in small groups have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism it said in a report this week domestically in america it has been well documented that the fbi created a counterintelligence program known as cointelpro similar in scope to the cia s operation chaos not only as a way to influence but also a way to disrupt and coerce both left and rightwing political factions from the inside out the fbi program infiltrated countless groups and movements across the political spectrumover the past several years the fbi has been routinely caught foiling their very own terror plots following one of america s most deadly mass shootings at the orlando pulse nightclub reports revealed that the fbi had a close relationship with the suspected attacker through the use of a wellknown confidential informant similarly recent reports state that fbi court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged home grown isis attack to take place in garland texas 21wire had previously uncovered the suspicious nature of the cartoonshooting event in garland when it occurredin 2015 another strange informant casefbi sting attempted to persuade a group into attacking the humphrey scottish rite masonic center in milwaukeequestion is it possible the fbi or any or intelligence

NEW YORK KNOWN WOLF: Halloween Truck Attacker Known to DHS Prior to ‘Act of Terror’,shawn helton 21st century wireyears before allegedly carrying out a truck rampage on halloween the man named in new york s most recent act of terror was already wellknown to the united states department of homeland security this latest supposedly homegrown isisinspired attack produces yet another known wolf with ties to suspected terrorists as well as authorities according to officials 29 yearold sayfullo saipov the man charged in a deadly manhattan vehicular assault on october 31st was previously questioned over suspected ties to terrorism in 2015 by the us department of homeland security saipov reportedly became a permanent legal resident upon arriving in the us on a diversity lottery visa in 2010 since that time the suspected terrorist moved from ohio florida and most recently to new jersey where he was interviewed by dhs in 2015as media attention on this case is focused on immigration laws terror propaganda and security protocols america s latest terror tragedy reveals much more below the surface known wolf there s a distinct pattern with acts of terror committed on western soil photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonanother american known wolf suspected terrorist sayfullo habibullaevic saipov who bounced across america committed only minor traffic violations before his alleged involvement in the new york truck attackover the past 24 hours the suspected truck attacker saipov was said to have driven a home depot rental truck from new jersey to the manhattan area where it is believed he deliberately targeted pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path alongside the hudson river according to police reports shortly after the vehicular attack authorities state that siapov brandished a pellet gun and paintball gun prior to being shot by nypd and taken into custody all told at least eight people were said to have been killed while nearly a dozen others were injured in the highprofile terror incidentreports state that saipov became radicalized in america allegedly taking ques from isis terror propaganda however saipov originally from tashkent the capital city of uzbekistan was supposedly from a modest and secular family that did not go to mosques making this yet another suspicious terrorrelated case that paints a murky portrait on the way towards extremism suspect the alleged new york truck attacker was apparently a registered driver for popular car services uber and lyft image source twitterrather intriguingly in a published report at abc news we re told saipov had been the subject of a deeper counterterror investigation back in 2015 sayfullo saipov who has been charged with killing eight people in a vehicle attack on the west side of manhattan on tuesday was interviewed in 2015 by federal agents about possible ties to suspected terrorists but a case was never opened against him law enforcement officials tell abc news continuing the article outlined the following saipov was listed as a point of contact for two men who were listed in a department of homeland security counterterrorism database and later overstayed their tourist visas a federal official told abc news one was flagged after arriving from a socalled threat country while the other vanished and was being actively sought by federal agents as a suspected terrorist incredibly in less than 24 hours after the deadly vehicular assault in new york fbi authorities have located the suspected terrorist who supposedly vanished from the gaze of authorities said to be linked to saipovtoday fbi investigators released an alert regarding 32 yearold mukhammadzoir kadirov a person of interest who authorities also believe is linked to the recent attackcnn reported the following background information regarding siapovin a recently published report from the ny times elements of a recent fbi probe into a suspected terror cell charged in brooklyn over the past two years was revealed over the last two years a terrorism investigation by the fbi the department of homeland security the new york police department and federal prosecutors in brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from uzbekistan and one from kazakhstan of providing material support to isis several of the men have pleaded guilty it is unclear whether mr saipov was connected with that investigation question will the fbi eventually reveal that saipov and kadirov were on their radar prior to the new york truck attack only time will tell this latest act of terror in america may well prove to be similar in scope to many other known wolf cases in recent history as readers might recall the alleged new york bombing suspect 28 yearold ahmad khan rahami had been known to the fbi for years prior to supposedly carrying out plots in new york and new jersey in the fall of 2016according to the washington post the fbi had already known rahami since 2014 which only added to the strongly suspicious event the fbi s probe into ahmad khan rahami the 28yearold named as the only suspect in the bombings was launched based on comments his father had made an official said his father later recanted his comments agents conducted interviews checked with other agencies and looked at internal databases none of which revealed ties to terrorism the bureau said in a statement dark days the crime scene of the recent new york truck attack image source twitterhand in hand terror  security question is it possible the fbi or any intelligence agency played some part in the latest new york city attack plot whether inadvertently or otherwisein the search for answers regarding the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies that have come into question there s none perhaps more dubious than the fbi s newburgh sting operation that resulted in the entrapment four men who participated in a fabricated event created by the bureauhere s a 2011 passage from the guardian describing how a fbi informant named shahed hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot the newburgh four now languish in jail hussain does not for hussain was a fake in fact hussain worked for the fbi as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicalsyet far from being active militants the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with newburgh s grim epidemic of crack drug crime and poverty one had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine he also believed florida was a foreign countryhussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot including 250000 to one man and free holidays and expensive carsas defence lawyers poured through the evidence the newburgh four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial fbi policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets there has been no case as egregious as this it is unique in the incentive the government provided a quarter million dollars said professor karen greenberg a terrorism expert at fordham university the reputation of the fbi has suffered greatly in the recent past as well as over the past couple of decades following the 1993 wtc bombing the fbi was revealed to have been handling emad a salem a former egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the bomb plotquestion will authorities reveal that siapov may have also had ties to informants or other known wolveshere at 21wire we ve kept a running report on known wolf

Robert Parry: Sorting Out the Russia Mess,consortium news exclusive the us mainstream media finally has its smoking gun on russiagate incriminating information from a junior trump campaign adviser but a closer look reveals serious problems with the evidence writes robert parryby robert parryrussiagate special prosecutor robert mueller has turned up the heat on president trump with the indictment of trump s former campaign manager for unrelated financial crimes and the disclosure of a guilty plea from a lowlevel foreign policy adviser for lying to the fbiwhile longtime republican fixer paul manafort who helped guide trump s campaign to the gop nomination in summer 2016 was the big name in the news on monday the mainstream media focused more on court documents related to george papadopoulos a 30yearold campaign aide who claims to have heard about russia possessing hillary clinton s emails before they became public on the internet mostly via wikileakswhile that would seem to bolster the russiagate narrative that russian intelligence hacked democratic emails and president vladimir putin ordered the emails be made public to undermine clinton s campaign the evidentiary thread that runs through papadopoulos s account remains tenuousthat s in part because his credibility has already been undermined by his guilty plea for lying to the fbi and by the fact that he now has a motive to provide something the prosecutors might want in exchange for leniency plus there is the hearsay and contested quality of papadopoulos s supposed information some of which already has turned out to be falseaccording to the court documents papadopoulos got to know a professor of international relations who claimed to have substantial connections with russian government officials with the professor identified in press reports as joseph mifsud a littleknown academic associated with the university of stirling in scotlandthe first contact supposedly occurred in midmarch 2016 in italy with a second meeting in london on march 24 when the professor purportedly introduced papadopoulos to a russian woman whom the young campaign aide believed to be putin s niece an assertion that mueller s investigators determined wasn t truetrump who then was under pressure for not having a foreign policy team included papadopoulos as part of a list drawn up to fill that gap and papadopoulos participated in a campaign meeting on march 31 in washington at which he suggested a meeting between trump and putin a prospect that other senior aides reportedly slapped downthe email breakfastbut papadopoulos continued his outreach to russia according to the court documents which depict the most explosive meeting as an april 26 breakfast in london with the professor mifsud supposedly saying he had been in moscow and learned that the russians had obtained dirt on thencandidate clinton and possessed thousands of emails mainstream press accounts concluded that mifsud must have been referring to the laterreleased emailshowever mifsud told the washington post in an email last august that he had absolutely no contact with the russian government and described his ties to russia as strictly in academic fieldsin an interview with the uk daily telegraph after monday s disclosures mifsud acknowledged meeting with papadopoulos but disputed the contents of the conversations as cited in the court papers specifically he denied knowing anything about emails containing dirt on clinton and called the claim that he introduced papadopoulos to a female russian national as a laughingstock according to the telegraph interview mifsud said he tried to put papadopoulos in touch with experts on the european union and introduced him to the director of a russian think tank the russian international affairs councilit was the latter contact that the court papers presumably referred to in saying that on may 4 the russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to papadopoulos and mifsud reporting that ministry officials were open for cooperation a message that papadopoulos forwarded to a senior campaign official asking whether the contacts were something we want to move forward with however even an article in the new york times which has aggressively pushed the russiagate scandal from the beginning noted the evidentiary holes that followed from that pointthe times scott shane wrote a crucial detail is still missing whether and when mr papadopoulos told senior trump campaign officials about russia s possession of hacked emails and it appears that the young aide s quest for a deeper connection with russian officials while he aggressively pursued it led nowhere shane added the court documents describe in detail how mr papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with russian officials the documents do not say explicitly whether and to whom he passed on his most explosive discovery that the russians had what they considered compromising emails on mr trump s opponent jd gordon a former pentagon official who worked for the trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the march 31 foreign policy meeting said he had known nothing about mr papadopoulos discovery that russia had obtained democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with russians reasons to doubtif prosecutor mueller had direct evidence that papadopoulos had informed the trump campaign about the clinton emails you would assume that the proof would have been included in monday s disclosures further since papadopoulos was flooding the campaign with news about his russian outreach you might have expected that he would say something about how helpful the russians had been in publicizing the democratic emailsthe absence of supporting evidence that papadopoulos conveyed his hot news on the emails to campaign officials and mifsud s insistence that he knew nothing about the emails would normally raise serious questions about papadopoulos s credibility on this most crucial pointat least for now those gaps represent major holes in the storyline but official washington has been so desperate for proof about the alleged russian election meddling for so long that professional skepticism has been unwelcome in most media outletsthere is also another side of the story that rarely gets mentioned in the us mainstream media that wikileaks founder julian assange has repeatedly denied that he received the two batches of purloined democratic emails one about the democratic national committee and one about clinton s campaign chairman john podesta from the russians while it is surely possible that the russians might have used cutouts to pass on the emails assange and associates have suggested that at least the dnc emails came from a disgruntled insideralso former us intelligence experts have questioned whether at least one batch of disclosed emails could have come from an overseas hack because the rapid download speed is more typical of copying files locally onto a memory stick or thumb drivewhat i was told by an intelligence source several months ago was that russian intelligence did engage in hacking efforts to uncover sensitive information much as us and other nations intelligence services do and that democratic targets were included in the russian effortbut the source said the more perplexing question was whether the kremlin then ordered release of the data something that russian intelligence is usually loath to do and something that in this case would have risked retaliation from the expected winner of the 2016 election hillary clintonbut such questions and doubts are clearly not welcome in the us mainstream media most of which has embraced mueller s acceptance of papadopoulos s story as the longawaited smoking gun of russiagateinvestigative reporter robert parry broke many of the irancontra stories for the associated press and newsweek in the

MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS: Was Sandy Hook Shooter Known to FBI Prior to School Massacre?,21st century wire says the fbi recently released new documents regarding the bizarre and still forensically critiqued sandy hook elementary school shooting tragedy sandy hook many questions still remain in this perplexing case photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonkey point it s important to remember that even though the events at sandy hook were said to have been carried out by a deranged lone gunman named adam lanza initial reports on several cbs and abc affiliates following the sandy hook mass shooting stated there was a second shooter who was apprehended at the scenewe should also be reminded that mainstream media reportage of the sandy hook tragedy took audiences down several rabbit holes of their own making eventually implicating an unlikely suspect left photo with asperger s syndrome in an apparently motiveless crimenot since the forensically questionable columbine high school shooting massacre had the corporate media been so fixated on a tragic shooting focusing their efforts on politicizing the apparent crime while investigators offered very little in terms of evidence in their official storyon march 28th of 2013 a few short months after the sandy hook shooting an article entitled newtown killer s obsessions in chilling detail was published by the ny times in that article the public learned that the lanza s were unknown to authorities and that there were never any disturbances at the family residence that would have prepped law enforcement prior to the school shooting two lawenforcement officials who were initially involved in the investigation said in recent interviews that the newtown police had never been called to the lanza home for any disturbances and that before the shootings the family was basically unknown to the authoritiesthey said they believed that mr lanza had spent most of his time in the basement of the home primarily playing a warfare video game call of duty this aspect of the story had remained virtually unquestioned until the recent release of fbi information this weekearlier this week an nbc affiliate in connecticut published an article disclosing the newly released fbi documents regarding the sandy hook case here s a short passage of that article the documents include reports by fbi agents who interviewed people about lanza large portions of many of the documents were redacted including the names of the people who spoke to the agentsthe documents also offer a window into the early days of the investigation as agents chased false leads and gathered evidence of lanza s isolationa year after the massacre state police released a final investigative document that concluded lanza was obsessed with firearms death and mass shootings but that the motive may never be known while the article continued by placing a heavy emphasis on the media crafted stagelike persona of the alleged shooter adam lanza we re told for the first time of his alleged sexual perversions as the video gamegun obsessed millennial apparently also spent time analyzing mass shooting crimesthis murky portrait of the sandy hook shooter finally emerges nearly five years after the media sensationalized school shooting but perhaps the most shocking claim has come from an unnamed newtown resident alleging that lanza may have already been wellknown to the fbi or possibly the cia prior to the sandy hook school massacre occurring a newtown resident told the fbi that nancy lanza said adam had once hacked into a government computer system and federal authorities either fbi or cia agents showed up at their doornancy lanza told the person that she had to convince the agents that her son was just very intelligent and was challenging himself to see if he could hack into a government system she said agents told her that if adam was that smart he could get a job with their agency someday question why is the public just now learning that lanza may have already been known to authorities via his government computer hack and why wouldn t various intelligence agencies continue to monitor his behavior after committing an illegal act that may have been a national security concernthe troubling sandy hook saga continues to have more questions than answers read more daily shooter news at 21st century wire daily shooter filessupport 21wire subscribe  become a member  21wiretv,US_News,25-Oct-17,0

New Survey Shows No.1 Fear of US Citizens is Government NOT Terrorism,americans have lost the plot when it comes to evaluating the true nature of the terrorist threat image source wikicommonsby matt agoristan extensive survey of hundreds of adults across the united states has just revealed that the thing most americans fear more than anything else is their own government in fact according to the survey no other fear even comes close to the percentage of americans who worry about their corrupt government officialsthe survey was conducted by chapman university and it serves to back up the point that while americans claim to live in the land of the free deep down they realize they are living in a corrupt oligarchy the chapman university survey of american fears wave 4 2017 provides an indepth examination into the fears of average americans in may of 2017 a random sample of 1207 adults from across the united states were asked their level of fear about eighty different fears across a huge variety of topics ranging from crime the government the environment disasters personal anxieties technology and many others as statista s niall mccarthy notes like last year corruption of government officials came top in 2017 with 745 percent of us adults saying it makes them afraid or very afraid despite the constant fear mongering from the mainstream media and government on bogeymen terrorists plotting to steal our freedom the public according to this survey is not buying itin fact the threat of terrorism isn t even in the top 20 fears terrorism comes in at twentytwo below credit card fraud and identity theftwhile this survey is certainly promising in the idea that people are waking up to government corruption it is also a telling sign of america s ability to hold two entirely contradictory ideas as selfevidentthis ability or perhaps better defined as disability to hold two opposing ideas such as the spreading of freedom through war as being logically sound is called cognitive dissonance when one is in a state of dissonance they may sometimes feel disequilibrium  frustration hunger dread guilt anger embarrassment anxiety etcin order for cognitive dissonance to work society must remain just ignorant enough to support and to believe the lies fed to them from the establishment as reality even though this reality is a complete contradictiononce we step back and observe society with this in mind the reason for this contradictory mental state becomes quite obvious it is much easier to remain delusional and in a state of suspended disbelief than it is to deal with the opposing ideas held inside one s head how can one chant usa is number 1 while at the same time fearing the rulers of that usa  if this survey shows us anything it is that americans would do well to entertain the uncomfortable idea that this country they hold so high up on a pedestal has actually long been on a path to become the dystopian nightmare written about in books like 1984americans would do well to remember the words by john basil barnhill in 1914 when he said where the people fear the government you have tyranny where the government fears the people you have liberty this article first appeared the free thought projectread more war on terror news at 21st century wire war on terror filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,US_News,23-Oct-17,0
"WHITE WASHED? Trump Claims Classified JFK Files Will Be Released, Reigniting Conspiracy Suspicions",shawn helton 21st century wire jfk files conspiracy still shrouds the jfk assassination photo illustration shawn heltonthe assassination of us president john f kennedy is one of the most infamous crimes of the 20th century like the enigmatic attacks of 911 it was an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy intrigue and mystery despite the lone gunman theory implicating lee harvey oswaldnew reports indicate that classified documents pertaining to the assassination of the 35th us president will be allowed to be released by us president donald trumpthe ny times reports the release of the information being held in secret at the national archives including several thousand neverbeforeseen documents was mandated to occur by oct 26 under a 1992 law that sought to quell conspiracy theories about the assassinationmr trump has the power to block the release of the documents and intelligence agencies have pressured him to do so for at least some of them the agencies are concerned that information contained in some of the documents could damage national security interestsin a statement to reporters the white house left open the possibility that mr trump might halt the release of some documents while word of a possible release of neverbeforeseen jfk files has spread like wildfire throughout mainstream media and alternative media alike one should remain skeptical and cautious as the likelihood of the military industrial complex the cia and other clandestine agencies releasing any conclusive interagency conspiracy related details about the jfk assassination is next to zerothe globalist deep state machine that has ruled the us and the world since wwii would have too much to lose if anything larger came out of america s most infamous conspiracy it would be like opening pandora s box image source circololettoriithere s one theory in the mystery surrounding jfk s assassination that includes some uncanny historical and hollywood associations that we are not likely to hear about in 1980 after a sixhour suicidal standoff with police a contract killer linked to organized crime named charles harrelson admitted to killing us district judge john h wood and in the process while apparently high on cocaine also claimed to have been involved in the assassination of president john f kennedythe father of hollywood star woody harrelson was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named sam degelia jr in 1968 and in 1981 charles received two life sentences for the murder of john woodthroughout 1981 more questions materialized regarding the assassination of judge wood in a upi article defense lawyers maintained charles harrelson was framed by police and the informant charles an exfelon said a friend hampton robinson iii who failed to show up to testify had driven the car he suggested someone possibly federal agents had planted the guns so he could be arrested he denied telling department of public safety agent pagel he carried a gun three tramps charles harrelson id d by forensic experts on the left is believed to be one of three arrested in dealey plaza after jfk s assassination in 1963 image source jfkmurdersolvedwhen considering the harrelsonkennedy connection the 1989 book crossfire comes to mindcrossfire written by the recently deceased wellknown researcher jim marrs was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful oliver stone film jfk below is a passage from crossfire as it relates to the apparent harrelsonkennedy link aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire harrelson the father of actor woody harrelson had a long history of involvement with dallas underworld characters linked directly to jack ruby continuing the crossfire also stated the late fort worth graphics expert jack white who testified before the house select committee on assassinations already had noticed the resemblance of harrelson to the youngest tramp in a 1981 interview with chuck cook harrelson claimed to have the biggest story the reporter would ever have when questioned about kennedy s death additionally jo ann harrelson noted the similarities between the tramp photos and her husband all this coupled with the fact diane lou oswald the mother of woody harrelson who had also been married to charles harrelson in midland texas made for a strange background concerning the jfk sagain a kdfwtv interview in 1982 below charles harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing kennedy but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the us government s involvement in the death of kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in americathe interview is a startling revelation adding to the enigmatic jfk mystery and in the process provides another strange backdrop to a captivating case  21st century wire says today president donald trump announced he plans to release the tens of thousands of classified documents on the assassination of president john f kennedy held at the national archives and records administration the president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise a white house official told reuters subject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened trump tweeted on saturdaysubject to the receipt of further information i will be allowing as president the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 21 2017days before trump s announcement the washington post claim that their national security council source told deep state media oracle that federal government agencies have warned the president not to release some of the documents for fear they could somehow comprise national security  although this rationale is hard to justify as the event took place nearly 55 years ago unless of course some legacy parties still in power today were implicated in the remaining documentsit s difficult to know if trump is referring to all of the remaining cia and fbi documents or just some of them or whether or not these documents will be redacted presumably to protect any important names involved in the jfk murder or possible coverup however trump appears to have left open the possibility that if government agencies feel the documents should not to released then he would heed their advice trump added that his decision was subject to the receipt of further information according to phil shenon a professional researcher and author on the warren commission it s great news that the president is focused on this and that he s trying to demonstrate transparency but the question remains whether he will open the library in full every word in every document as the law requires shenon said and my understanding is that he won t without infuriating people at the cia and elsewhere who are determined to keep at least some of the information secret especially in documents created in the 1990s the scheduled date of the release is meant to be on october 26 2017stay tuned for more updatesread more jfk news at 21st century wire jfk

‘Man Bites Dog’: New York Times Does Some Actual Journalism,what this story shows is that while there are some conscientious journalists at the new york times who have made a concerted effort to discover the truth about president trump s somewhat outlandish claim that the cuban government have deployed sonic attacks against us diplomats in havana the paper s editors also ran with the predictable mainstream conspiracy theory that putin might be behind this malicious hightech assault on us foreign service officialsis there an internal struggle underway in mainstream media institutions between those who want to retain their integrity and gatekeepers determine to use these outlets to peddle establishment propagandaconsortium news exclusive when the trump administration blamed cuba for a sonic attack on us diplomats a new york times reporter did something unusual for his newspaper he tried objectively to assess the evidence as robert parry reports by robert parryi often criticize the new york times washington post and other major mainstream media outlets for a very simple reason they deserve it especially for their propagandistic unprofessional and reckless coverage of foreign crisesbut there are occasional moments when some reporter at an msm outlet behaves responsibly and those instances should be noted at least under the classic definition of news something that is unexpected or as the old saying goes dog bites man is not news man bites dog is news one such moment occurred earlier this month when a times science editor assigned science reporter carl zimmer to look into the mysterious illnesses affecting us diplomats in the recently reopened us embassy in cubaabout two dozen us diplomats supposedly were suffering hearing loss and cognitive difficulties due to what has been labeled a sonic attack the trump administration blamed the cuban government even though the cubans claimed to be mystified and would seem to have little motive for disrupting a longsought d tente with washington along with the expected boon to their tourist industry president trump retaliated by expelling 15 cuban diplomatszimmer recounted the background to his story in a reporter s notebook piece on oct 6 on tuesday michael mason my editor on the science desk shot me an email would i consider writing an article about this sonic attack business  i knew exactly what he was talking about i had been vaguely puzzled about this business for months checking out the storyzimmer then did what professional journalists are supposed to do he started contacting impartial experts to get their assessments of what was possible what was likely and what didn t make sense i decided to try to find something out not as a political reporter but as a science writer zimmer wrote in the sidebar that accompanied his news article i usually base my ideas on scientific research that has matured far enough that it is beginning to get published in peerreviewed journals i knew that an article on sonic weapons would be very different from the ones i usually write i learned there was not even an official medical report i decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story is the idea of a sonic attack plausible based on what scientists know about sound and the human body so i hit the phone i didn t want to talk with just anyone i looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question i started with timothy leighton whose job title at southampton university is literally professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics better yet dr leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that i m aware of when i interviewed dr leighton and others i made clear i didn t expect them to solve this mystery i just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science the consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon it would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously yet despite this skeptical scientific consensus among experts zimmer noted the notion of a sonic attack has ricocheted like mad around the press making it possible for readers to assume that the sonic attack explanation has been generally accepted by experts but it most certainly has not i ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation suspecting putinwell zimmer could have read the times editorial in the same day s oct 6 newspaper for a partial answer while critical of the trump administration for rushing to judgment in blaming the cuban government and expelling 15 diplomats the editorial concluded the sonic attacks on americans are too serious to be used for cynical political ends so much for the editorial writers reading their own newspaper but clearly they were driven by a higher agenda a new york times editorial about some unpleasant topic anywhere in the world these days wouldn t be complete without taking the opportunity to blame russia or in this case at least suggest russia as a possible villain in the mysterythe times wrote other parties most notably russia must also figure as suspects president vladimir putin would probably welcome a setback to americancuban relations yes every possible conspiracy theory must somehow circle back to vladimir putin a reallife dr evil when he is not plotting how to flood facebook with images of puppies or manipulate americans in their pursuit of pokemon go characters he is building secret sonic weapons to disorient us diplomats in havana and provoke president trump to act rashly when we all know how cool and collected trump

STRANGER THAN FICTION: Why Is Foundation of Vegas Shooting Survivor Sponsored By DHS Linked Firm?,shawn helton 21st century wirewhen looking at the deeply entangled mystery surrounding the las vegas mass shooting there s been no shortage of questionable details and information that just doesn t add upyou know the old adage truth is often stranger than fiction vegas questions who is working behind the scenes concerning the high desert phoenix foundation photo illustration 21wire s shawn heltonthe shooting involving the las vegas mandalay bay resort and route 91 harvest festival has ushered in the brutal return of politicized mass tragedy in america the dramatic nature of the surreal as of yet still motiveless crime only adds to a traumatic event that is now being described as the 911 of mass shootings similarly over this past week a story of concerning the sudden tragic death of a las vegas shooting survivor sent shock waves through both mainstream media and alternative media alikeas a chorus of gripping media reports detailed the unexpected death of 28 yearold kymberley jo synder suchomel left photo daily press in the days after the las vegas mass shooting those still in search of answers in the aftermath of the tragedy were left captivated by her taleby now many may already be familiar with media accounts of suchomel s harrowing tale of survival who along with close friends was said to have attended the route 91 harvest festival the night of the las vegas shooting massacreas the untimely circumstances of suchomel s death have been conflated with the unexplained events in las vegas many in alternative media have hastily assumed that the young fund raiser s death was somehow linked to her dispute of the las vegas mass shooting storyline via social media posts on a facebook account associated with her subsequently online interpretations of the suchomel story have led to a digital firestorm on social media producing a wave of speculation prior to a more complete analysis of the survivor s taledespite sensationalized reportage at this time there s no concrete evidence to prove a social mediabased conspiracy concerning the death of suchomel according to the original story first published by the daily press we re told suchomel died in her sleep as she was said to have suffered from epilepsy and had been prone to seizures additionally suchomel who was reportedly taking medication for a pituitary tumor was discovered dead by her grandmother julie norton at 830am on october 9th at her apple valley california home at this moment an autopsy of suchomel s death is still pendingquestion is it possible that open source investigators were being led into a virtual culdesac and thus missing the real storymedia tripwireundoubtedly the uncanny timing of suchomel s death has come on the heels of a brewing controversy over the las vegas mass shooting this has led to increased speculation turbocharging even more spurious internetbased conspiracies and allegations these now viral stories have simultaneously been published as anonymous survivor claims from those close to suchomel have presented facebook messages associated with her account suchomel s claims also allude to multiple shooters involved in the las vegas shooting as she allegedly planned to organize a group of survivors and that the media can suck it they have no idea what went down while suchomel s story is compelling you have to wonder is there more than we ve been toldat face value suchomel s public account of the las vegas shooting is persuasive and does appear to question the official narrative however one should look at information from multiple angles in order to formulate a more full spectrum understanding of complex multilayered criminalityupdate below are two screen shots associated with a linkedin profile under the name of kymberley suchomel we at 21wire cannot verify if this profile is connected in anyway to the las vegas shooting survivor or not but several similarities in the appearance of the individual home location and the inclusion of an aerospace industry government contractor aerozone along with others raises some serious questions the inclusion of the above linkedin profile is not necessarily an endorsement of a larger conspiracy concerning the suchomel saga however the linkedin revelations above have surfaced at or around the same time as other government contractor links have been uncovered regarding the las vegas shooting survivor s charitable foundation see belowquestionis the linkedin profile above a ruse someone else or another mysterious part of the suchomel storysee also the las vegas mass shooting more to the story than we ve been toldalthough the police dispatch communication along with eyewitness testimony reveals some startling information contradicting the official story surrounding the las vegas mass shooting one must be cautious when looking at all of the available evidence of a suspicious crime however difficult that may beas larger outlets in alternative media such as infowars have sensationalized this highly emotive aspect of the las vegas tragedy a series of formulaic polarizing political points have become an echo chamber in its aftermath this type of conjecture rapidly descends into wild speculation only serving to magnify emotionally driven elements of a particular story something that could be used to deliberately steer public perception away from any potential forensic cluesit s important to remember that during same time site intelligence injected an isis meme into the las vegas tragedy without revealing any solid evidence infowars quickly followed suit this then prompted an apparent official statement that echoed those dubious claims from the terror group isis although these claims still linger they ve failed to produce any real connection to isisas we ve noted numerous times here at 21wire the intelligence monitoring group called site has ties to both the cia and israeli intelligence the group has also had ethical concerns raised over the nature of their intel gathering in the last decade and according to the group s founder rita katz they ve managed to release terror related material linked to isis prior to the group itself geo group a privateforprofit corrections and detention firm formerly known as wackenhut corrections corporation under the umbrella of the wackenhut corporation image source corporatewatchstrange bedfellows follow the moneywhat you re about to see below is a collection of material revealing what appears to be a rather incredible financial component connected to the high desert phoenix foundation a charitable organization cofounded by the recently deceased las vegas mass shooting survivor kymberley suchomel the high desert phoenix foundation claims to have raised funds for grieving families affected by trauma since 2008 this amazing coincidence rather incredibly has not been mentioned once in any of the conspiratorial claims surrounding the suchomel story at alternative media outlets put another way a survivor of a traumatic event has been a long time cofounder of a foundation that contends to have helped those who have endured a traumatic tragedy themselves it s a difficult question to ask but what are the chances of this uncanny coincidencefurthermore new evidence uncovers details concerning the high desert phoenix foundation s highprofile sponsors one that includes the the geo group inc geo this long time financial donor is also linked to wellknown government contractor security firms is this also a coincidencein recent years controversy has enveloped the multibilliondollar corporation known as geo group critics of geo group contend that politically motivated contributions have led to an expansion of its forprofit prisons system through federal state and government contractual agreements at the expense of public safety even more concerning is that critics argue that geo group has fostered a dangerous work environment via it s under staffed operations inadequate training and apparent mistreatment of detainees and other inmates this has led to a potentially volatile situation for communities nearby geo group s facilities question does this sound like a suitable donor for a charitable foundation known for helping grieving familiesin 1984 wackenhut corrections corporation wcc had been formed as a part of the wackenhut corporation in 2003 wcc management bought up all stock held by its subsidiary g4s altering its name to the geo group incin 2004 other divisions of the wackenhut corporation were purchased by group 4 falck a security focused subsidiary known as g4s wackenhut was later renamed again as g4s secure solutionshere s a screen shot of the high desert phoenix foundation s mission statement notice the modest look of the website an organization with the financial backing of the multibillion dollar geo group one of the nation s largest forprofit prison operators the reason why the geo group link is so significant is that prior to modern america s largest mass shooting in las vegas an apparent survivor of the incident was operating a foundation that was accepting financial support from a largescale company formerly known as the wackenhut corporation a subsidiary of g4s secure solutions one of the world s largest security firms and a department of homeland security connected conglomerate tied to the suspicious orlando shooting in the summer of 2016 an event that was previously the country s largest mass shooting if you remember

federal cabinet department in addition to apparently providing security solutions for 90 percent of us nuclear facilities g4s according to border patrol sources has also been tasked with the

ANTIFA: Self-Appointed Radical Revolutionaries or Neoliberal Thought Police?, antifa photo twitterdiana johnstone 21st century wire fascists are divided into two categories the fascists and the antifascists  ennio flaianoin recent weeks a totally disoriented left has been widely exhorted to unify around a masked vanguard calling itself antifa for antifascist hooded and dressed in black antifa is essentially a variation of the black bloc familiar for introducing violence into peaceful demonstrations in many countries imported from europe the label antifa sounds more political it also serves the purpose of stigmatizing those it attacks as fascists despite its imported european name antifa is basically just another example of america s steady descent into violencehistorical pretensionsantifa first came to prominence from its role in reversing berkeley s proud free speech tradition by preventing right wing personalities from speaking there but its moment of glory was its clash with rightwingers in charlottesville on august 12 largely because trump commented that there were good people on both sides  with exuberant schadenfreude commentators grabbed the opportunity to condemn the despised president for his moral equivalence  thereby bestowing a moral blessing on antifacharlottesville served as a successful book launching for antifa the antifascist handbook whose author young academic mark bray is an antifa in both theory and practice the book is really taking off very fast  rejoiced the publisher melville house it instantly won acclaim from leading mainstream media such as the new york timesthe guardian and nbc not hitherto known for rushing to review leftwing books least of all those by revolutionary anarchiststhe washington post welcomed bray as spokesman for insurgent activist movements and observed that the book s most enlightening contribution is on the history of antifascist efforts over the past century but its most relevant for today is its justification for stifling speech and clobbering white supremacists bray s enlightening contribution is to a tell a flattering version of the antifa story to a generation whose dualistic holocaustcentered view of history has largely deprived them of both the factual and the analytical tools to judge multidimensional events such as the growth of fascism bray presents today s antifa as though it were the glorious legitimate heir to every noble cause since abolitionism but there were no antifascists before fascism and the label antifa by no means applies to all the many adversaries of fascismthe implicit claim to carry on the tradition of the international brigades who fought in spain against franco is nothing other than a form of innocence by association since we must revere the heroes of the spanish civil war some of that esteem is supposed to rub off on their selfdesignated heirs unfortunately there are no veterans of the abraham lincoln brigade still alive to point to the difference between a vast organized defense against invading fascist armies and skirmishes on the berkeley campus as for the anarchists of catalonia the patent on anarchism ran out a long time ago and anyone is free to market his own genericthe original antifascist movement was an effort by the communist international to cease hostilities with europe s socialist parties in order to build a common front against the triumphant movements led by mussolini and hitlersince fascism thrived and antifa was never a serious adversary its apologists thrive on the nipped in the bud claim if only antifascists had beat up the fascist movements early enough the latter would have been nipped in the bud since reason and debate failed to stop the rise of fascism they argue we must use street violence which by the way failed even more decisivelythis is totally ahistorical fascism exalted violence and violence was its preferred testing ground both communists and fascists were fighting in the streets and the atmosphere of violence helped fascism thrive as a bulwark against bolshevism gaining the crucial support of leading capitalists and militarists in their countries which brought them to powersince historic fascism no longer exists bray s antifa have broadened their notion of fascism to include anything that violates the current identity politics canon from patriarchy a prefascist attitude to put it mildly to transphobia decidedly a postfascist problemthe masked militants of antifa seem to be more inspired by batman than by marx or even by bakuninstorm troopers of the neoliberal war partysince mark bray offers european credentials for current us antifa it is appropriate to observe what antifa amounts to in europe todayin europe the tendency takes two forms black bloc activists regularly invade various leftist demonstrations in order to smash windows and fight the police these testosterone exhibits are of minor political significance other than provoking public calls to strengthen police forces they are widely suspected of being influenced by police infiltrationas an example last september 23 several dozen blackclad masked ruffians tearing down posters and throwing stones attempted to storm the platform where the flamboyant jeanluc m lenchon was to address the mass meeting of la france insoumise today the leading leftist party in france their unspoken message seemed to be that nobody is revolutionary enough for them occasionally they do actually spot a random skinhead to beat up this establishes their credentials as antifascist they use these credentials to arrogate to themselves the right to slander others in a sort of informal selfappointed inquisitionas prime example in late 2010 a young woman named ornella guyet appeared in paris seeking work as a journalist in various leftist periodicals and blogs she tried to infiltrate everywhere  according to the former director of le monde diplomatique maurice lemoine who always intuitively distrusted her when he hired her as an internviktor dedaj who manages one of the main leftist sites in france le grand soir was among those who tried to help her only to experience an unpleasant surprise a few months later ornella had become a selfappointed inquisitor dedicated to denouncing conspirationism confusionism antisemitism and redbrown on internet this took the form of personal attacks on individuals whom she judged to be guilty of those sins what is significant is that all her targets were opposed to us and nato aggressive wars in the middle eastindeed the timing of her crusade coincided with the regime change wars that destroyed libya and tore apart syria the attacks singled out leading critics of those warsviktor dedaj was on her hit list so was michel collon close to the belgian workers party author activist and manager of the bilingual site investig action so was fran ois ruffin filmmaker editor of the leftist journal fakir elected recently to the national assembly on the list of m lenchon s party la france insoumise and so on the list is longthe targeted personalities are diverse but all have one thing in common opposition to aggressive wars what s more so far as i can tell just about everyone opposed to those wars is on her listthe main technique is guilt by association high on the list of mortal sins is criticism of the european union which is associated with nationalism which is associated with fascism which is associated with antisemitism  hinting at a penchant for genocide this coincides perfectly with the official policy of the eu and eu governments but antifa uses much harsher languagein midjune 2011 the antieu party union populaire r publicaine led by fran ois asselineau was the object of slanderous insinuations on antifa internet sites signed by marieanne boutoleau a pseudonym for ornella guyet fearing violence owners cancelled scheduled upr meeting places in lyon upr did a little investigation discovering that ornella guyet was on the speakers list at a march 2009 seminar on international media organized in paris by the center for the study of international communications and the school of media and public affairs at george washington university a surprising association for such a zealous crusader against redbrown in case anyone has doubts redbrown is a term used to smear anyone with generally leftist views that is red with the fascist color brown  this smear can be based on having the same opinion as someone on the right speaking on the same platform with someone on the right being published alongside someone on the right being seen at an antiwar demonstration also attended by someone on the right and so on this is particularly useful for the war party since these days many conservatives are more opposed to war than leftists who have bought into the humanitarian war mantrathe government doesn t need to repress antiwar gatherings antifa does the jobthe francoafrican comedien dieudonn m bala m bala stigmatized for antisemitism since 2002 for his tv sketch lampooning an israeli settler as part of george w bush s axis of good  is not only a target but serves as a guilty association for anyone who defends his right to free speech such as belgian professor jean bricmont virtually blacklisted in france for trying to get in a word in favor of free speech during a tv talk show dieudonn has been banned from the media sued and fined countless times even sentenced to jail in belgium but continues to enjoy a full house of enthusiastic supporters at his oneman shows where the main political message is opposition to warstill accusations of being soft on dieudonn can have serious effects on individuals in more precarious positions since the mere hint of antisemitism can be a career killer in france invitations are cancelled publications refused messages go unansweredin april 2016 ornella guyet dropped out of sight amid strong suspicions about her own peculiar associationsthe moral of this story is simple selfappointed radical revolutionaries can be the most useful thought police for the neoliberal war partyi am not suggesting that all or most antifa are agents of the establishment but they can be manipulated infiltrated or impersonated precisely because they are selfanointed and usually more or less disguisedsilencing necessary debateone who is certainly sincere is mark bray author of the intifa handbook it is clear where mark bray is coming from when he writes p367 hitler s final solution murdered six million jews in gas chambers with firing squads through hunger an lack of medical treatment in squalid camps and ghettoes with beatings by working them to death and through suicidal despair approximately two out of every three jews on the continent were killed including some of my relatives this personal history explains why mark bray feels passionately about fascism  this is perfectly understandable in one who is haunted by fear that it can happen again however even the most justifiable emotional concerns do not necessarily contribute to wise counsel violent reactions to fear may seem to be strong and effective when in reality they are morally weak and practically ineffectualwe are in a period of great political confusion labeling every manifestation of political incorrectness as fascism impedes clarification of debate over issues that very much need to be defined and clarifiedthe scarcity of fascists has been compensated by identifying criticism of immigration as fascism this identification in connection with rejection of national borders derives much of its emotional force above all from the ancestral fear in the jewish community of being excluded from the nations in which they find themselvesthe issue of immigration has different aspects in different places it is not the same in european countries as in the united states there is a basic distinction between immigrants and immigration immigrants are people who deserve consideration immigration is a policy that needs to be evaluated it should be possible to discuss the policy without being accused of persecuting the people after all trade union leaders have traditionally opposed mass immigration not out of racism but because it can be a deliberate capitalist strategy to bring down wagesin reality immigration is a complex subject with many aspects that can lead to reasonable compromise but to polarize the issue misses the chances for compromise by making mass immigration the litmus test of whether or not one is fascist antifa intimidation impedes reasonable discussion without discussion without readiness to listen to all viewpoints the issue will simply divide the population into two camps for and against and who will win such a confrontationa recent survey shows that mass immigration is increasingly unpopular in all european countries the complexity of the issue is shown by the fact that in the vast majority of european countries most people believe they have a duty to welcome refugees but disapprove of continued mass immigration the official argument that immigration is a good thing is accepted by only 40 compared to 60 of all europeans who believe that immigration is bad for our country  a left whose principal cause is open borders will become increasingly unpopularchildish violencethe idea that the way to shut someone up is to punch him in the jaw is as american as hollywood movies it is also typical of the gang war that prevails in certain parts of los angeles banding together with others like us to fight against gangs of them for control of turf is characteristic of young men in uncertain circumstances the search for a cause can involve endowing such conduct with a political purpose either fascist or antifascist for disoriented youth this is an alternative to joining the us marinesamerican antifa looks very much like a middle class wedding between identity politics and gang warfare mark bray page 175 quotes his dc antifa source as implying that the motive of wouldbe fascists is to side with the most powerful kid in the block and will retreat if scared our gang is tougher than your gangthat is also the logic of us imperialism which habitually declares of its chosen enemies all they understand is force although antifa claim to be radical revolutionaries their mindset is perfectly typical the atmosphere of violence which prevails in militarized americain another vein antifa follows the trend of current identity politics excesses that are squelching free speech in what should be its citadel academia words are considered so dangerous that safe spaces must be established to protect people from them this extreme vulnerability to injury from words is strangely linked to tolerance of real physical violencewild goose chasein the united states the worst thing about antifa is the effort to lead the disoriented american left into a wild goose chase tracking down imaginary fascists instead of getting together openly to work out a coherent positive program the united states has more than its share of weird individuals of gratuitous aggression of crazy ideas and tracking down these marginal characters whether alone or in groups is a huge distraction the truly dangerous people in the united states are safely ensconced in wall street in washington think tanks in the executive suites of the sprawling military industry not to mention the editorial offices of some of the mainstream media currently adopting a benevolent attitude toward antifascists simply because they are useful in focusing on the maverick trump instead of themselvesantifa usa by defining resistance to fascism as resistance to lost causes the confederacy white supremacists and for that matter donald trump is actually distracting from resistance to the ruling neoliberal establishment which is also opposed to the confederacy and white supremacists and has already largely managed to capture trump by its implacable campaign of denigration that ruling establishment which in its insatiable foreign wars and introduction of police state methods has successfully used popular resistance to trump to make him even worse than he already wasthe facile use of the term fascist gets in the way of thoughtful identification and definition of the real enemy of humanity today in the contemporary chaos the greatest and most dangerous upheavals in the world all stem from the same source which is hard to name but which we might give the provisional simplified label of globalized imperialism this amounts to a multifaceted project to reshape the world to satisfy the demands of financial capitalism the military industrial complex united states ideological vanity and the megalomania of leaders of lesser western powers notably israel it could be called simply imperialism  except that it is much vaster and more destructive than the historic imperialism of previous centuries it is also much more disguised and since it bears no clear label such as fascism  it is difficult to denounce in simple termsthe fixation on preventing a form of tyranny that arose over 80 years ago under very different circumstances obstructs recognition of the monstrous tyranny of today fighting the previous war leads to defeatdonald trump is an outsider who will not be let inside the election of donald trump is above all a grave symptom of the decadence of the american political system totally ruled by money lobbies the militaryindustrial complex and corporate media their lies are undermining the very basis of democracy antifa has gone on the offensive against the one weapon still in the hands of the people the right to free speech and assemblydiana johnstone is author of the introduction to her father s

Reflections on a World Gone Mad and Pushing Back against Neocolonialist Thuggery, andre vltchek anti diplomaticothe following is an interview with andre vltchek by alessandro biancchi chief editor of the italian political magazine antidiplomaticoalessandro bianchi selfdetermination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country this is of the most complicated issue for international law how can it be articulated for the case of cataloniaandre vltchek personally i m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states particularly those in the west where they would after gaining independence  remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world like nato or the european unionclearly the breaking of the great country of yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile evil design by the west and particularly of germany and austria the dissolution of czechoslovakia after the socalled velvet revolution was a total idiocybut catalonia or basque country if it became independent would become one of the richest parts of europe i don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world as an internationalist i don t really care if they are separate from spain or not or whether they are even richer than they already are as i care much more about what is happening in places such as afghanistan venezuela or north koreaon the other hand the way spain has now behaved in catalonia after the referendum is a total disgrace they decided to treat the catalan people in the same way as indonesians have been treating papuans for decades if this continues it will all reach the point of no return reconciliation will become impossible you cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers one by one just because they want to have their own state you cannot injure hundreds of innocent people who simply don t want to be governed from madrid that s absurd and thoroughly sick of course spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called latin america so it is in their blood  but i don t think catalans will allow this to be done to themwhat about the constitution of spain look there should be nothing sacred about constitutions in the west they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes when they get outdated they should be moderated or totally rewritten if catalans or basques want their independence if they really want it if it is so important for them then why not they should have it spain is not a people s country  it is an oppressive western bully i would have a totally different position if some part of bolivia or china were to try to secedeab different situation and different reality another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of iraqi kurdistan which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area would it be the new israel in the middle east as someone has affirmedav well that is really a very serious issue i have worked in the kurdish autonomous region of iraq already twice even on the border with mosul and what i saw there i did not like at allit is clearly a client state of the west of turkey and to some extent israel it is shamelessly capitalist taking land from its own people cheating them just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil it treats syrian refugees like animals forcing them to make antiassad statements it is turning ancient erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight its military top brass is mainly usuktrained and indoctrinated and it provokes baghdad day and nighti really strongly disliked what i saw there if iraqi kurds were allowed to have their independence  the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative baghdad should not allow it even at the cost of an armed confrontationab coming to the question of the moment the nuclear escalation in north korean and a possible escalation of war on the korean peninsula what is your opinion about kim s strategy and what are the real risksav there is only one real risk and danger that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything i see no other serious problem that the world today is facingwhat is kim s strategy to defend his people by all means against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men women and children of korea that brutal force is the west and its allies it is all very simple but only if one is willing to turn off the bbc and to use his or her own brain it becomes obvious ab according to many for pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like iraq and libya do you not believe that the sanctions of the united nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalationav of course but they sanctions are still imposed on the victim it is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of western demagogues and dictators the world resembles the areas occupied by the nazi germany and italy and japan during the wwii there nobody would dare to vote independently defending victims of fascismab the us federation of science fas estimates that in 2017 north korea has fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch the us possesses 6800 nuclear heads the french and british respectively 300 and 215 respectively included nato s nuclear forces have 7315 nuclear warheads of which 2200 are ready to launch compared to 7000 held by the russians of which 1950 are ready to launch with chinese 270 pakistani 120130 indian 110120 and israeli 80 the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15000 by default the west is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened and so the threatened search to procure them is north korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world as it seems in the mainstream mediaav of course north korea is no threat at all i have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews i visited north korea and mingled with its people there nobody wants war the north korean people paid a terrible price for their independence its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by western forces its women were brutally raped entire villages and towns leveled to the ground or burned to ashes all this is never discussed in the west but is remembered in north koreanow absolutely shameless british propaganda is preparing the world public for the inevitability of the war you know if someone in this day and age still believes that the united states is the only culprit he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed made in europe  most evidently in the uk where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally the british colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister but strategically it is simply brilliant it was utilized for centuries and it even succeeded in programming the brains of the victims in the subcontinent africa and elsewhereof course your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd but day and night people are told that north korea represents a true danger to the world the same was said about the soviet union china cuba iraq afghanistan and many other countries most of these countries have already been destroyednorth korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender to fall on its knees to sacrifice its people it refuses to become a slave for centuries european and later us colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways western culture is after all based and built on slavery it demands absolute compliance unconditional submissionif north korea is attacked it should fight back and it willab the united nations adopted the important treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in july the united nations is often used in alternate ways and countries this treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers including by members of nato with us nuclear weapons including italy nato has banned member states from ratifying it can the west have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like saddam and gaddafiav the west is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city to rape everything that moves burn the center loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders a few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall and they catch him and judge him and feel totally morally righteous it is all so comical but that is not how you are supposed to see itab russia and china with iran venezuela and many other countries are intensifying dedollarization in their mutual exchanges does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussionsav yes definitely and you should talk about it to my friend peter koenig a true dissident a former economist at the world bank who is now actually advising many countries on dedollarizationus dollars should not be used anymore western institutions should be ignored totally new structures should be and are being erected china and russia are of course in the lead all this is extremely important and can change the world in the near futureab venezuela with the convening of the constituent assembly turned off the coup attempts of the opposition in brazil lula is favored in polls while in argentina the former president cristina fernandez is back in the senate with strong popular support so it was not the end of the progressive cycle as the mainstream has for years statedav of course it was not the end the desire of lain americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong it cannot be destroyed overnightthere were some serious setbacks in argentina and brazil and venezuela is suffering immensely battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad but the country is still standingin brazil temer is immensely unpopular his constitutional coup will soon backfire pt will be back in its old form or in a new one and it will be much stronger than before the same goes for argentina you see despite all the media manipulation propaganda and shameless lies people are already realizing that they were fooled they want some decency back they want socialism and pride and hope they want true independencein two weeks from now i m going back to

Santilli Freed Under Plea Pact as Vegas Shooting Casts Shadow on Bundy Trial, long shadow the wake of the recent mass tragedy in las vegas has overtaken various current events including the bundy trial image mandalay bay hotel  resort by mark anderson the truth houndlas vegas although the ongoing bundy trial in the us district court in las vegas nevada has had its share of dramatic changes that s especially true latelya major twist is that internetradio personality pete santilli one of seven defendants in the trial that had been set to begin with jury selection on oct 10th before it was delayed again plead guilty on friday oct 6 and was released pending sentencing confirmed his attorney chris rasmussen of las vegasrancher cliven bundy held without trial for over 18 monthsin that highly anticipated trial with santilli now excluded due to his plea the federal government is trying elder rancher cliven bundy image left his sons ammon and ryan and militia leader ryan payne two other defendants o scott drexler and eric parker who are being retried for a third time from earlier proceedings will join the others in this second of three planned trialsanother development affecting the trial is concern that the oct 1st mass shooting at mandalay bay hotel might prevent the defendants from getting a fair shake according to ryan payne s attorney the vegas shooting has the potential to bias jurors and has asked that the trial be moved to nevada s second largest city reno located seven hours north of las vegasbut while moving the proceedings 450 miles away to reno s federal court appears unlikely as of this writing the las vegas federal court issued yet another delay in this complicated trial therefore the previously announced oct 10 date for jury selection for the second trial will be changed to on or around oct 30thand even that could be subject to change again given the already bumpy track record of this multipledefendant case in which the federal government has had a hard time making its allegations stickonly gregory burleson who s wheelchairbound and reportedly has developed blindness has been sentenced to 68 years no less he was convicted in the first trial that began in early february a codefendant in that trial todd engel is expected to be sentenced dec 22 though several other defendants have been cleared of numerous chargessantilli s journeysantilli who shot extended livestream video footage at the malheur national wildlife refuge building near burns oregon was held on remand for his role in that latter2015 early2016 affairthe controversial internet radio personality has had his share of critics both in and out of the court room some critics alleged that his some of the journalistic coverage shot in oregon enabled the government to more closely monitor the bundys and their supporters who had peacefully occupied the abandoned building to protest onerous federal land controls and the unlawful arrest of the hammonds local ranchers who had fallen foul of federal agents from the bureau of land management blm others however felt his coverage would have provided a helpful account of events had federal agents decided to take the building by force during the oregon hearings his defense attorney argued that much footage which he had broadcast on his youtube channel should be considered as protected speech under the first amendmenton the eve of last september s oregon trial santilli had all charges dismissed against himalthough later cleared of oregonrelated charges santilli remained in federal custody and was transferred to nevada to stand trial for his role in the famous spring 2014 standoff at bundy ranch in bunkerville nevada an event that saw cliven bundy his sons and other supporters gather to protest the policies of the blm and other agenciesfederal agents unsuccessfully attempted to confiscate cliven s cattle over alleged claims that he owed significant federal grazing fees and concerning a epa court order over a contested environmental mitigation policy concerned the relocation of the desert tortoise from the onset of the controversy cliven bundy has maintained the federal government lacks jurisdiction in that part of southern nevada and that the fees don t apply citing legal and historical matterssantilli released before the trialin nevada santilli pleaded guilty to count 2 a single felony count of obstruction of justice based on the government s claim that he used his own vehicle to impede the movement of an approaching blm convoy during the attempted cattle impoundment interestingly during that incident after the convoy stopped federal agents and their guard dogs were then confronted by members of the bundy family and their supporters santilli then filmed the altercation including federal agents tasering ammon bundy and posted it on youtube which went instantly viral garnering nearly 15 million views in just a few days the video was then syndicated on fox news and other national outlets many had credited santilli s original video entitled ranch riot as one of the key catalysts for the one thousand or so supporters and militia who then arrived at bundy ranch over the following 72 hours before the standoff on april 12 2014like all the other defendants he was initially charged with all 16 counts contained in the original federal complaint which carried a potential maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction for all or most of those countsinterestingly santilli s attorney mr rasmussen motioned in court and later told this writer that the government may consider the prison time that santilli has already served behind bars since jan 26 2016 as either sufficient punishment for that felony charge in a bestcase scenario or the court may at least consider giving him credit for that time served even if he s given a longer sentence at his expected sentencing hearing on jan 11 2018 at 8 amplea bargain detailsa reading of the plea agreement shows that the government reserves the right to impose a longer prison term possibly six years on santillialso rasmussen noted that residing judge gloria navarro is not bound by the agreement s recommendations meaning she could choose to alter them when she sentences santillimeanwhile two pending defense motions one to exclude oregonrelated evidence in the government s nevada case against santilli and another to challenge the government s claim that santilli could not excuse his nevada actions because of his journalistic background have become moot due to this plea bargain rasmussen addedthe agreement s terms may raise the question of whether the other defendants actions will be seen in a more negative light given the fact that santilli s guilty plea to the felonyobstruction charge requires under penalty of perjury that he accept the following governmentsourced narrative as true and correct the maximum penalty for conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer as this count against santilli is formally named under 18 usc 372 is six years imprisonment a fine of 250000 or bothbut in the shifting sands of these proceedings the understanding at this juncture is that santilli will owe neither a fine nor restitution nor will there be forfeiture of his assets provided he meets the terms of his release until he s sentenced although according to rasmussen santilli will not be electronically monitored despite speculation that he would be taggedreturning to internet radionotably santilli who is expected to return to his hometown of cincinnati ohio during the week starting monday oct 16 will reportedly be allowed at least for the time being to resume broadcasting his news contentasked if santilli would be able to comment on the bundy trial itself rasmussen replied in writing he can do whatever he wants as long as he s not committing crimes the first amendment allows him to comment on anything unless it is threatening or inciting violence furthermore attorney rasmussen said that santilli is under a selfimposed gag order not a governmentimposed one meaning he has chosen not to talk to reportersalso santilli will not testify against the other defendants and will not have to turn over his journalistic work products but only raw discovery information from court proceedings and the plea bargain stresses he must remain crimefree regarding federal state and local laws and among other things must avoid any known association with anyone who s breaking any law the plea agreement also restricts him from significant travel initially only between southern nevada and cincinnati ohionor can santilli possess a gun or any other item deemed by the government as a weapon just failing to show up for a hearing or some

Another Revision in Las Vegas Mass Shooting – Amid Mandalay Bay Security Guard’s Media Silence,shawn helton 21st century wirefor the second time this week las vegas police officials and the fbi have revised significant timeline details associated with the las vegas mass shooting what does this latest change meannote the las vegas mass shooting currently modern america s deadliest has already been cycled out of most trending media reports in less than two weeks as most mainstream outlets have now focused the public s attention on a readytogo show trial involving disgraced hollywood movie mogul harvey weinstein while abuse of any kind is abhorrent you have to wonder why the las vegas massacre has seemingly been flushed out of the mainstream coverage so rapidly following a media frenzy collapse of a hollywood insiderover the past 24 hours independent reportage by former project veritas operative laura loomer suggests that the campos family may have had a gag order placed on them concerning details related to the las vegas shooting case however official confirmation of this aspect of the case is still pendingthis story follows yet another major shift in the las vegas shooting timeline as accounts on social media also suggest that some from independent media were kept out of the latest las vegas press conferencesee also the las vegas mass shooting more to the story than we ve been toldincredibly police and fbi have once again revised timeline details associated with mandalay bay security guard jesus campos and the alleged shooter now stating that the guard s encounter with the suspected gunman started near the same time as the concert mass shootingunsure lombardo looks down in doubt as overseer fbi special agent aaron rouse keeps a watchful eye over the struggling sheriffwatch below as a noticeably agitated las vegas sheriff joseph lombardo now claims that the 959 time frame is when campos supposedly investigated a nearby door alarm on the 32nd floor as previously reported when this story first brokethe las vegas review journal confirms the sheriff said monday that stephen paddock shot mandalay bay security guard jesus campos at 959 pm about six minutes before the gunman turned his weapons on the route 91 harvest festival crowd below his hotel suite he previously reported campos was shot after the attack on the concert crowd here s the latest lvmpd press conference concerning the las vegas mass shooting on october 13th one of the more disturbing aspects of the aftermath of the las vegas mass shooting has been the production of emotionally charged press conferences that have inundated viewers with endless canned talking points constant revisions of timeline details and reversed statements all serving to continually cloud the official storylombardo also lashed out at critics of the investigation in the public space the word incompetence has been brought forward he said and i am absolutely offended with that characterization review journalto the casual observer you have to wonder why they haven t been able to keep a straight story if the police are getting such basic elements of the story wrong then the public has to ask what else have they got wrongthis type of ritualized media grandstanding has become an almost mechanical hallmark following most largescale active shooter and first responder events as it usually dissolves into more of a media parade meant to convince the public of certain details of a crime rather than address forensic anomalies which clearly don t add upwhile law enforcement looks to tie up loose ends and shore up any early holes or bizarre theories it s possible that a more thorough analysis of all the forensic data in the case will be pushed into the background as any new information may be introduced to steer those critical of the official storyover the past 24 hours reports state that campos who was scheduled for at least five tv interviews abruptly disappeared prior to those appearances one such interview included a fox news interview with sean hannity this twist in the las vegas shooting has added another bizarre aspect to an already strange case here s fox news below the mandalay bay security guard shot by stephen paddock in the moments leading up to the worst mass shooting in modern us history was set to break his silence thursday night with five television interviews including one on fox news campos union president saidexcept when the cameras were about to roll and media gathered in the building to talk to him campos reportedly bolted and as of early friday morning it wasn t immediately clear where he was we were in a room and we came out and he was gone campos union president told reporters according to abc news stephanie wash the motive for the

US Gov’t War on RT: Imperial Media ‘Truth’ Monopoly Threatens Press Diversity,taking the mickey rt uk billboard campaign on london underground pokes fun at usled russiagate campaign of hysteriaphilip giraldi unz reviewsomehow everything keeps coming back around to russia in one of its recent initiatives the justice department doj appears to be attacking the first amendment as part of the apparent bipartisan program to make vladimir putin the fall guy for everything that goes wrong in washington in the past month the doj has revealed that the fbi is investigating russian owned news outlets sputnik news and rt international and has sent letters to the latter demanding that one of its business affiliates register as a foreign agent by october 17th the apparent line of inquiry that the bureau is pursuing is that both are agencies of the russian government and that both have been spreading disinformation that is intended to discredit the united states government and its institutions this alleged action would make them in the doj view a propaganda arm of a foreign government rather than a news service it also makes them subject to department of the treasury oversight under the foreign agents registration act of 1938sputnik which is owned by a russian government media group headed by putin consigliere dimitri kiselyov has been under investigation due to the accusations made by a fired broadcaster named andrew feinberg feinberg the former sputnik white house correspondent reportedly took with him a thumb drive containing some thousands of internal business files when he left his office he has been interviewed by the fbi has turned over his documents and has claimed that much of the direction over what the network covered came from moscowrt america more television oriented than sputnik operates through two business entities rttv america and rttv studios the department of justice has refused to identify which of the businesses has been targeted by a letter calling for registration under fara but it is believed to be rttv america which provides both operational support of the broadcasting as well as the production facilities both companies are actually owned by russianamerican businessman alex yazlovsky though the funding for them presumably comes from the russian governmenti have noticed very little pushback in the us mainstream and alternative media regarding the department of justice moves presumably because there is a broad consensus that the russians have been interfering in our democracy and have had it coming if that assumption on my part is correct the silence over the issue reflects a certain na vete while also constituting a near perfect example of a pervasive tunnel vision that obscures the significant collateral damage that might be forthcomingnews organizations are normally considered to be exempt from the requirements of fara the department of justice action against the two russian major media outlets is unprecedented insofar as i could determine even qatar owned aljazeera which was so vilified during the early stages of the afghan war that it had its kabul offices bombed by the us did not have to register under fara was permitted to operate freely and was even allowed to buy a television channel license for its american operationsthe doj is in effect saying that rt and sputnik are nothing more than propaganda organs and do not qualify as journalism i would have to disagree if one goes by the standards of contemporary journalism in the united states america s selfdescribed newspapers of record the new york times and the washington post pretend that they have a lock on stories that are true the post has adopted the slogan democracy dies in darkness while the times proclaims the truth is more important now than ever but anyone who has read either paper regularly for the past year knows perfectly well that they have been as often as not leading propaganda organs for hillary clinton and the democratic party pushing a particular agenda and denigrating donald trump they differ little from the admittedly biased television news reporting provided by fox news and msnbcwhat exactly did the russians do according to last january s report signed off on by the fbi cia and nsa which may have motivated the doj to take action rt and sputnik consistently cast presidentelect trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional us media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment well they certainly got that one right and did better in their reporting of what was going on among the american public than either the washington post or new york timesregarding sputnik feinberg claimed inter alia that he was pushed to ask questions at white house press briefings suggesting that syria s bashar alassad was not responsible for some of the chemical attacks that had taken place one wonders at feinberg s reluctance as sputnik and rt were not the only ones expressing skepticism over the claims of syrian involvement which have been widely debunked and why is expressing a credible alternative view on an event in syria even regarded as propaganda damaging to the american publicthere is a difficult to distinguish line between fara restricted trying to influence opinion using what is regarded a fake news and propaganda and legitimate journalism reporting stories where the facts have been challenged even real journalists choose to cover stories selectively inevitably producing a certain narrative for the viewer listener or reader all news services do that to a greater or lesser extenti have considerable personal experience of rt in particular and to a lesser extent with sputnik i also know many others who have been interviewed by one or both no one who has done so has ever been coached or urged to follow a particular line or support a specific position insofar as i know nor do i know anyone who has actually been paid to appear most of us who are interviewed are appreciative of the fact that we are allowed to air views that are essentially banned on the mainstream media to include critique of maladroit policies in places like syria and afghanistan and biting critiques of the war on terrorsputnik in my opinion does however lean heavily towards stories that are critical of the united states and its policies while rt has a global reach and is much more balanced in what it covers for sure it too criticizes us policies and is protective of the russian government but it does not substantially differ from other national news services that i have had done interviews for i find as much uniquely generated negative reporting about the us usually linked to violence or guns on bbc world news france24 and deutsche welle as i do on rt international to describe it as part of an influence campaign driven by a staterun propaganda machine has a kernel of truth but it is nevertheless a bit of a stretch since one could make the same claims about any government financed news service including voice of america governments only get into broadcasting to promote their points of view not to inform the publicthere is a serious problem in the threats to use fara as it could advance the ongoing erosion of freedom of the press in the united states by establishing the precedent that a foreign news services that is critical of the us will no longer be tolerated it is also hypocritical in that countries like israel that interfere regularly in american politics are exempt from fara registration because no one dares to take such a step while russia is fair gamegoing after news outlets also invites retaliation against us media operating in russia and eventually elsewhere currently western media reports from russia pretty much without being censored or pressured to avoid certain stories i would note a recent series that appeared on cbs featuring the repulsive stephen colbert spending a week in russia which mercilessly lampooned both the country and its government no one arrested him or made him stop filming no one claimed that he was trying to undermine the russian government or discredit the country s institutions even though that is precisely what he was doingand then there is the issue of the threat posed by news media outlets like rt and sputnik even combined the two services have limited access to the us market with a 2014 study suggesting that they have only 28 million actual weekly viewers rt did not make the cut and is not included on the list of 100 most popular television channels in the us and it has far less market penetration than other foreign news services like the bbc it can be found on only a limited number of cable networks in a few mostly urban areas it does better in europe but its profile in the us market is miniscule as even bad news is good news in terms of selling a product it probably did receive higher ratings when the intelligence agency report slamming it came out on it in january everyone probably wanted to learn what rt was all aboutso it seems to me that the united states moves against rt and sputnik are little more than lashing out at a problem that is not really a problem in a bid to again promote the russian threat to explain the ongoing dysfunction that prevails in america s democratic process one keeps reading or hearing how the american government has indisputable proof of moscow s intentions to subvert democracy in the us as well as in europe but the actual evidence is still elusive will russiagate end with a bang or a whimper no one seems to

“Russia Did It” is Smokescreen for Big Business Ownership of US Government and Congress,finian cunningham sputnikgoogle is the latest us internet company to claim it found russialinked advertisements on its network allegedly posted to influence the us presidential election last yeartwitter and facebook have already made similar claims and all three are now facing more scrutiny in the coming weeks before congressional committeeswhat is truly astounding about this hysteria over alleged russian interference in us democracy is that american citizens are being distracted from what is by far the much more alarming issue of how their government and congress is bought by us big businessbloomberg reported this week that google identifies russian election interference network  it said the internet giant found political ads worth 4700 which it believes are tied to the russian government  these ads it is claimed carried political articles which were meant to influence which way american citizens would vote in the presidential contest between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump last novembergoogle has reportedly said that another 53000 worth of ads are under review for suspicion of being linked to the russian government this follows claims made by facebook that it had earlier identified 100000 spent on ads by russian sources while twitter said it had located 274000 worth of such adsthe russian government has repeatedly rejected accusations that it tried to meddle in the us election moscow rightly highlights the dearth of any evidence and total lack of due legal process the american allegations have also whipped up a toxic climate to curb the legitimate media activities of russian news channelsit is understood that russia s stateowned news channel rt promoted some of its content through social media like facebook and twitter but as rt editor margarita simonyan pointed out such promotion is entirely normal for all news media companies she estimated that usbased outlets probably spent much more than rt promoting their content through the russian section of twitterseveral issues about this russian meddling trope are patently dodgy yet are bizarrely overlookedthe first is that as with other claims of russian interference in the us election no evidence is ever presented facebook twitter and google are making vague claims of accounts believed to be tied to the russian government  and the us news media simply repeat these nebulous claims without further questiona second anomaly is that congressional committees that have been investigating allegations of russian interference have also not presented any evidence after nearly nine months of intensive probingsenators richard burr and mark warner who are heading up a select intelligence committee made a big presentation last week in washington on their findings the findings turned out to be an embarrassing anticlimax the congressmen admitted they found no evidence of russia collusion in the election and baldly asserted that moscow s influence campaign continues which they will continue to investigate no doubt at a huge cost to american taxpayersso russia is being accused of interfering in the presidential elections on the basis of the allegation alone and yet american politicians are also contradicting themselves by saying that the alleged interference did not alter the vote outcomebut here is the biggest absurdity the sums of money claimed to have been used by russia to destabilize us democracy are ridiculously minusculefor argument sake let s go along with the claims that somehow russian agents took out ads on social media to influence the us election between facebook twitter and google the expenditure amounts to about 300000that figure is a pittance compared with the avalanche of money that us corporations doled out to bankroll the election campaigns of the two candidatesaccording to bloomberg hillary clinton s election bid was leveraged with 12 billion from superpacs political action campaigns trump received less corporate money raising a total of 647 million or about half of what clinton s coffers receivednow put those figures into perspective the alleged russian influence ads costing around 300000 represent some 001 percent of what us corporations actually spent 18 billion total in promoting either clinton or trump for the white house in other words the much speculated and highly dubious financial outlay that russian sources allocated to allegedly upset the american democratic process is negligible compared with the actual money spent by major american companies to determine the 2016 election outcomewhile american media and politicians are endeavoring to get citizens all worked up about kremlin meddling the glaring fact is that their democratic process is subject to enormous us corporate influence and not just the 2016 election every presidential cyclenote too that this is only taking into consideration the corporate lobbying in the presidential contest every year it is calculated that us companies spend about 3 billion lobbying federal government and congressthat is every year year after year big business in america spends 10000fold on influencing lawmakers and government policy compared with the alleged ad campaign that russia supposedly engaged inanother source of major influence on american politicians are the lobby groups funded separately by the israeli and saudi government interests each year these foreign states spend an estimated 57 million on lobbying members of the us congress and the federal government this is real money with real impact on us democracy as opposed to alleged russian interferencegetting back to lobbying by us companies some might call it bribery among the biggest donors are the military manufacturing firms according to american publication the hill included in the top 50 corporate lobbies plying congress with campaign funds are boeing lockheed martin and northrup grummananother major lobby although not in the top 50 is the national rifle association nra which promotes gun ownership for private citizens by donating to congress membersthree recent events show how corporate money effectively buys american government policypresident trump is pushing for an overhaul of tax policy which will result in the biggest ever tax benefit to corporate americasecondly with regard to the us military budget the congress is due to pass a record increase amounting to 700 billion annually this largesse to pentagonconnected manufacturers like lockheed martin and boeing is no doubt fueled by trump using reckless bellicose rhetoric towards north korea threatening war instead of a diplomatic solutionthirdly in the aftermath of the latest mass shooting in las vegas the worst ever in modern us history in which 58 people were mowed down by a 64yearold male shooter armed with an arsenal of assault rifles in his hotel room both the white house and congress are adamant that now is not the time to talk about gun control laws  congressional republicans in particular are big recipients of nra funding trump s election campaign also reportedly received 30 million from the nrain the gargantuan scale of corporate funding and influence on us democracy it is patently absurd for us media and politicians to chase after russia for alleged

Agent Angelina: Are CIA Using Hollywood’s Jolie as Soft Power Operative?,21st century wire says in previous articles 21wire has consistently raised the question of whether or not the cia and the pentagon have been using hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas this charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a conspiracy theory even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice and one with historic precedents seems that the mainstream claim that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that won t fly anymore we have talked about dennis rodman and george clooney as two highprofile ambassadors of the us inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various pr strategic or intelligence endsthis latest admission regarding actress angelina jolie is even more telling where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive and possibly nonexistent joseph kony of the lord s resistance army in the jungles of ugandaandrew korybko oriental reviewit s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes cia psyop narratives in her films but this time new leaks allege that angelina jolie had also at one time considered being the pentagon s bait to catch kony  which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities foreign policy forays such as dennis rodman s friendship with kim jongun agent angelinaangelina jolie is the poster woman for the hollywoodintelligence complex  the perfect example of a willing cia asset who regularly goes along with deep state narratives in her films such as the antiserb production in the land of blood and honey  she s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for humanitarian interventions abroad or in other words imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated humanitarian reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in darfur jolie often visits us troops abroad like in afghanistan though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefieldthat s no longer the case anymore though according to a report by the sunday times a ukbased media outlet which claims to have read leaked international criminal court icc documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal african warlord joseph kony the sunday times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall however so the average information consumer needs to rely on secondhand sources such as people magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge according to the celebrity news site a hoard of 40000 icc documents leaked to the french investigative website mediapart reveals that jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal ugandan warlord joseph konyshe has the idea to invite kony to dinner and then arrest him reads an email sent by former icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo reports the sunday times forget other celebrities she is the one moreno ocampo adds in another email she loves to arrest kony she is ready probably brad pitt will go also according to the sunday times which has seen the mediapart documents moreno ocampo hoped that jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the central african republic with a team of us special forcesit was thought that their presence would then draw kony out of his armored compound and enable the us forces to take him into custody if these allegations are true then it would mean that jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of hollywood operatives to an infield asset of the pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission truth be told catching kony  as the viral 2012 slogan went isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native uganda the democratic republic of the congo south sudan and the central african republic in fact the whole purpose of the cia psyop to catch kony was to justify us special forces presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in south sudan and the central african republic which would turn them into a failed state belt that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a chinesebuilt bicoastal silk road through their resourcerich territoriesthe geopolitics of the kony diversion aren t the focus of this article so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this hybrid war campaign instead it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the deep state  both in the propaganda and as can now be seen infield operational manifestations thus far it doesn t seem like any of jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a highprofile covert mission but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example it s certainly possible that other famous people are doing something similar in serving their governmentsodd couple joseph kony  angelina joliethe rodmankim casethe most relevant case that comes to mind is dennis rodman who s the us kim whisperer in passing along messages through what he calls basketball diplomacy but who actually functions as the best american pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive north korean leader in person it s been speculated for a few years already that rodman might indeed be working for the cia but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either too stupid or that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that  but these critics never take the time to consider that rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushedup drug bust or something of that naturein any case his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with kim jongun although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur otto warmbier s release shortly before his death given that the american student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine he probably would have been released whether rodman came to the country or not but it s very telling that kim jongun refused to meet with his best friend during this time incidentally it was shortly after this that the war of words and insult diplomacy between the north korean and american leaders really took off which might have been inspired by trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious rodmankim connection because pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up toalthough it s only speculation at this point it would indeed explain why trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the madman theory in dealing with kim jongun as the us intelligence community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his north korean counterpart with rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful the us might have feared that kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking north korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear testthe above narrative might sound dubious upon first read but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that angelina jolie was working with the pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to catch kony  which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that dennis rodman might have been doing similar field work for the cia in collecting valuable personal intelligence about kim jonguneven if the north koreans are actually aware of what rodman is up to nowadays that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the hermit kingdom  as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the us deep state continue this story at oriental reviewread more hollywood news at 21st century wire hollywood

Iran ‘Will Respond’ if US Moves to Designate Revolutionary Guard as ‘Terrorist Group’,fresh off its humiliating sixyearlong debacle in syria and with very few viable wars within its grasp the pentagon along with the israeli lobbyled us congress and senate are now trying to tighten the noose on iranfor the last 3 weeks hawkish republican senators have been pressuring president donald trump to decertify the iran nuclear deal in october and to reimpose harsh sanctions despite the fact that iran is in full compliance with the international p51 brokered nuclear containment agreementaccording to the terms of the deal as recognized by congress the president must recertify the deal every 90 dayslittle marco it s clear that marco rubio is firmly in the pocket of the israeli lobbychief among

nuclear agreement makes little sense business insider explainsjohn glaser and emma ashford respond to trump s latest attack on the nuclear deal iran is clearly abiding by the deal s requirements as president trump himself has twice formally acknowledged but the president appears determined to ignore us allies his own intelligence community and the international atomic energy agency which has affirmed eight separate times in detailed reports that iran is in compliance with the dealas is usually the case the us hawks also supported by iran s economic and geopolitical regional rival saudi arabia are hoping to trigger retaliatory rhetoric from the iranian hawks and use those words to justify a call for escalation of tension and a full range of new sanctions against iranthis desire to withdraw from the jcpoa is difficult to explain whatever trump s reasoning this much is clear all of america s options outside the jcpoa carry unacceptably high risks and threaten to exacerbate the

"REVEALED: FBI Aided, Abetted ‘ISIS’ Terrorist Attack at ‘Mohammed Cartoon Event’ in Garland, Texas",daily shooter 21st century wirejust as isis is being routed in deir ezzor syria and soon out of raqqa and driven from its remaining strongholds in iraq we discover how the us government has been busy keeping the organization thriving within its own shoreswhat you are about to read is simply breathtaking but should be of no surprise to our readers these new court findings reaffirms much of what 21wire and the daily shooter column have been reporting for the last five years that the fbi is responsible for the majority of socalled terrorist attacks in the usaccording to a new legal case filed against the fbi court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged home grown isis attack to take place in garland texas on may 4 2015 international criminal lawyer jennifer breedon shows the fbi was complicit in the attack and even enticed the two terrorists to carry out the attack and where agents had pretended to be isis in order to keep their entrapment operation going she explains some of the facts are indicating that they had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with isis trying to find out these isis groups and he wanted to make himself higher up in isis ranks to know more of their fighters apparently he stayed in the car behind them which came out in another case filing with the fbi they did not prevent it because if the attack had been carried out successfully and people died it was likely this undercover agent and his supervisors in the fbi felt that this would promote him up to high ranks within isis the undercover agent would be promoted up because the attack was then successful read breddon s full interview hereon the surface this is a clear case of entrapment by the fbi but upon deeper examination it s now clear that the fbi seems to have aided and abetted a terrorist attack on us soilwhile other mainstream and alternative media outlets were busy promulgating the official narrative 21wire actually calledout the staged event designed to leverage a far right antimuslim agenda and stoke irrational fears of endless isis attacks on us soilprovocateur professional provocateur geller provided the pr bait for media the fbirun american isis cellthe contrived event was marketed as a controversial muhammad art exhibit and cartoon contest organized by a cutout politcal front group american freedom defense initiative led by antimuslim activist and professional provocateur pamela geller and featured farright dutch politician geert wilders as its keynote speaker media personality geller claimed to have purposely chosen the venue following the council on americanislamic relations cair gathering who held a stand with the prophet conference in late january 2015 after the charlie hebdo shootings in paris earlier that yearaccording to the victim s attorney breedon the fbi had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with isis trying to find out these isis groups and he wanted to make himself higher up in isis ranks to know more of their fighters american journalist trevor aaronson further explains the derelict role of james comey image left in fbi s attempt to cover its own fingerprints on this dodgy operation hours earlier the fbi had sent a bulletin to local police with elton simpson s photo warning that he was interested in the event fbi director james comey said in a press conference following the shooting that the fbi did not have reason to believe simpson was planning to attack the event even though the bureau had spent years trying to build a case against him entrapment the unwitting youngster elton simpson was groomed by a paid fbi informant and brought to the scene of the staged attack after the fbistaged attack  21wire was one of few media outlets to report how a paid fbi informant was not only handling  but directing what appeared to be a naive and vulnerable federal target for entrapment a new young muslim convert named elton simpson from phoenix arizonait s now been revealed that gunman  elton simpson was already under surveillance by the fbi and was even the subject of a terror investigation more importantly we can also confirm simpson was being handled by an fbi informant court papers filed in arizona name the fbi undercover informant as mr daba deng a kenyan and who from 2007 was paid 132000 by the fbi to become friends with mr simpson  and who appears to have groomed simpson through a local mosque and helped to develop simpson s ideas about jihad so keen was cnn at the time to convince its audience that garland was a real terrorist event it took the trouble of creating its own cartoon version of the attack in a desperate attempt to make the official story believablesynthetic terror cnn uses cartoon to make the garland shooting look like a real terror eventat the time and almost comically cnn tried to push the official narrative appearing totally clueless of the fact that the attackers were under fbi supervision for years he wasn t wellknown to federal law enforcement and was not on the fbi s radar one of the officials said investigators were combing through evidence retrieved from the shooters arizona home to help piece together a timeline of how their plot came together the official said it was as if cnn had copied and pasted their report from an fbi press memo issued after the event perhaps it was cnn s coverage of the event was equally ridiculous not picking up on the fact that a small platoon of heavily armed us special ops mercenaries were prepositioned at geller s event in anticipation of the madefortv terror attack that followedbreaking update from swat team leader wfaachannel8 pictwittercomhof5f4bf7u jobin panicker jobinpnews may 4 2015see our initial report on geller s garland hoax hebdo redux in garland texas mohammed cartoon shooting reeks of a staged false flaggarland was a clear case of the us government creating a terror threat where there was none and this wouldn t be the first time eitheras previously noted the guardian reported on the scale and scope of this trend in 2014 in some cases the fbi may have created terrorists out of lawabiding individuals by suggesting the idea of taking terrorist action or encouraging the target to act the list of fbirelated terrorist incidents inside the us is a long one the formula for creating a terror icon required a confidential informant to guide and manage the future suspect right up to the point of arrest or in some cases like the world trade center bombing in 1993 the fbi have even allowed the terrorist incident to take placein garland as with so many other high profile terror and mass shooting events 21wire s investigations have turned out to

Henningsen: Obama White House Colluded with Facebook to Fabricate ‘Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,washington dc this week the senate intelligence committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 election if anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented they would have been sorely disappointed again still that s not going to stop official washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory the issue of collusion is still open said committee chairman richard burr of north carolina r we have more work to do as it relates to collusion but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened likewise the committee s ranking democrat senator mark warner of virginia admitted they had nothing but implored americans to be on guard of the russian the russian active measures did not end on election day 2016 said warner he maintains that the us should adopt a more aggressive whole government approach to combat russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting americanshowever yesterday 21wire revealed via consortium news that it was senator warner along with the obama white house who colluded with silicon valley giant facebook in 2016 with warner making multiple trips to palo alto to pressure facebook to produce some evidence that warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of russian bots using facebook to interfere in the 2016 election as it turns out this was fake news fabricated by washington and its mainstream media partners21wire editor patrick henningsen spoke to rt international yesterday about these developments and how the us government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere by definition that collusion between big government and corporations is classic fascism watch what i will confirm is that the russian intelligence service is determined clever senator burr said and i recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously russiagate has really turned into a vaudeville actread more russiagate news at 21st century wire russiagate filessupport 21wire subscribe  become a member  21wiretv,US_News,6-Oct-17,0
Fake News: The Collapse of the MSM’s ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Story,as 21wire said last year the russian hacking or russiagate story was a political hoax from the start what this story can now demonstrate is that for the last 18 months the entire mainstream media has been promulgating a highly politicised and relentless campaign of fake news designed to implicate russia in an imaginary scandal leading the pack are former papers of record the new york times and the washington post flanked by america s premier broadcast tv propaganda outlet cnnlast week we revealed how powerful politicians in washington had pressured facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling demonstrating clear collusion between the obama administration and silicon valley corporation facebook with the goal of fabricating a scandal in order to scapegoat vladimir putin and the russians for the electoral collapse of hillary clinton last novemberas a result usrussian relations have been sacrificed at the altar of petty partisan politics and a failing deep state agendait certainly begs the question with so much at stake why would washington and msm lie and risk pushing global tensions closer to a world war level confrontation if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie aboutconsortium news exclusive the us mainstream media is determined to prove russiagate despite the scandal s cracking foundation and its inexplicable anomalies such as why russia would set up a facebook puppies pageby robert parrywhat is perhaps most unprofessional unethical and even immoral about the us mainstream media s coverage of russiagate is how all the stories start with the conclusion russia bad and then make whatever shards of information exist fit the preordained narrativefor instance we re told that facebook executives who were sent back three times by democratic lawmakers to find something to pin on russia finally detected 100000 worth of ads spread out over three years from accounts suspected of links to russia or similar hazy wordingthese facebook ads and 201 related twitter accounts we re told represent the longmissing proof about russian meddling in the us presidential election after earlier claims faltered or fell apart under even minimal scrutinyin the old days journalists might have expressed some concern that facebook found the ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians such as sen mark warner dvirginia the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry but today s mainstream reporters took warner s side and made it look like facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out therehowever it doesn t really seem to matter how little evidence there is anything will doeven the paltry 100000 is not put in any perspective facebook has annual revenue of 27 billion nor the 201 twitter accounts compared to twitter s 328 million monthly users nor are the hazy allegations of suspected links to russia subjected to serious inspection although russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests it s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by president vladimir putinyet if you look at some of the details about these 100000 in ads you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought the sum was spread out over 2015 2016 and 2017 and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of facebook activitybut more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before americans went to the polls last november according to facebook that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwardsfacebook added that roughly 25 of the ads were never shown to anyone for 50 of the ads less than 3 was spent for 99 of the ads less than 1000 was spent so as miniscule as the 100000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaignwhat about the puppieswe further have learned that most ads weren t for or against a specific candidate but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the united states and thus somehow undermine american democracyexcept it turns out that one of the issues was puppiesas mike isaac and scott shane of the new york times reported in tuesday s editions the russians who posed as americans on facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises there was even a facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads now there are a lot of controversial issues in america but i don t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list isaac and shane reported that there were also supposedly russialinked groups advocating gay rights gun rights and black civil rights although precisely how these divergent groups were linked to russia or the kremlin was never fully explained facebook declined to offer detailsat this point a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources who presumably include many partisan democrats and their political allies hyping the evilrussia narrative it would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy landyet instead of starting to question the overall premise of this scandal journalists at the new york times the washington post cnn etc keep making excuses for the nuttiness the explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious russians might be probing to discover americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda the goal of the dog lovers page was more obscure isaac and shane acknowledged but some analysts suggested a possible motive to build a large following before gradually introducing political content without viewing the entire feed from the page now closed by facebook it is impossible to say whether the russian operators tried such tactics seriously this is what the new york times is passing off as journalism nowthe joe mccarthy of russiagatethe times then turned to clinton watts a former fbi agent and a top promoter of the new mccarthyism that has swept official washington watts has testified before congress that almost anything that appears on social media these days criticizing a politician may well be

‘Russia Did It’ – The New Age of McCarthyism,robert parry consortium newsmake no mistake about it the united states has entered an era of a new mccarthyism that blames nearly every political problem on russia and has begun targeting american citizens who don t go along with this new cold war propagandaa difference however from the mccarthyism of the 1950s is that this new mccarthyism has enlisted democrats liberals and even progressives in the cause because of their disgust with president trump the 1950s version was driven by republicans and the right with much of the left on the receiving end maligned by the likes of sen joe mccarthy as unamerican and as communism s fellow travelers the real winners in this new mccarthyism appear to be the neoconservatives who have leveraged the democraticliberal hatred of trump to draw much of the left into the political hysteria that sees the controversy over alleged russian political meddling as an opportunity to get trump already the neocons and their allies have exploited the antirussian frenzy to extract tens of millions of dollars more from the taxpayers for programs to combat russian propaganda ie funding of nongovernmental organizations and scholars who target dissident americans for challenging the justifications for this new cold warthe washington post which for years has served as the flagship for neocon propaganda is again charting the new course for america much as it did in rallying us public backing for the 2003 invasion of iraq and in building sympathy for abortive regime change projects aimed at syria and iran the post has begun blaming almost every unpleasant development in the world on russia russia russiafor instance a post editorial on tuesday shifted the blame for the anemic victory of german chancellor angela merkel and the surprising strength of the farright alternative for germany afd from merkel s austerity policies which have caused hardship for much of the working class or from her open door for mideast refugees which has destabilized some workingclass neighborhoods to you guessed it russiathe evidence as usual is vague and selfinterested but sure to be swallowed by many democrats and liberals who hate russia because they blame it for trump and by lots of republicans and conservatives who have a residual hatred for russia left over from the old cold warthe post cited the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab which has been pushing much of the hysteria about alleged russian activities on the internet the atlantic council essentially is nato s think tank and is financed with money from the us government gulf oil states military contractors global financial institutions and many other sources which stand to gain directly or indirectly from the expanding us military budget and nato interventionsblaming russiain this new cold war the russians get blamed for not only disrupting some neocon regime change projects such as the proxy war in syria but also political developments in the west such as donald trump s election and afd s rise in germanythe atlantic council s digital lab claimed according to the post editorial that in the final hours of the german campaign online supporters of the afd began warning their base of possible election fraud and the online alarms were driven by anonymous troll accounts and boosted by a russianlanguage botnet of course the post evinces no evidence tying any of this to the russian government or to president vladimir putin it is the nature of mccarthyism that actual evidence is not required just heavy breathing and dark suspicions for those of us who operate web sites trolls some volunteers and some professionals have become a common annoyance and they represent many political outlooks not just russianplus it is standard procedure these days for campaigns to issue lastminute alarms to their supporters about possible election fraud to raise doubts about the results should the outcome be disappointingthe us government has engaged in precisely this strategy around the world having prous parties not only complain about election fraud but to take to the streets in violent protests to impugn the legitimacy of election outcomes that us strategy has been applied to places such as ukraine the orange revolution in 2004 iran the green revolution in 2009 russia the snow revolution in 2011 and many other locationspreelection alerts also have become a feature in us elections even in 2016 when both donald trump and hillary clinton raised questions about the legitimacy of the balloting albeit for different reasonsyet instead of seeing the afd maneuver as a typical ploy by a relatively minor party and the german election outcome as an understandable reflection of voter discontent and weariness over merkel s three terms as chancellor the atlantic council and the post see russians under every bed and particularly putinloving to hate putinin the world of neocon propaganda putin has become the great b te noire since he has frustrated a variety of neocon schemes he helped head off a major us military strike against syria in 2013 he aided president obama in achieving the iran nuclear agreement in 201415 putin opposed and to a degree frustrated the neoconsupported coup in ukraine in 2014 and he ultimately supplied the air power that defeated neoconbacked rebel forces in syria in 201517so the post and the neocons want putin gone and they have used gauzy allegations about russian meddling in the us and other elections as the new propaganda theme to justify destabilizing russia with economic sanctions and if possible engineering another regime change project in moscownone of this is even secret carl gershman the neocon president of the usgovernmentfunded national endowment for democracy publicly proclaimed the goal of ousting putin in an oped in the washington post writing the united states has the power to contain and defeat this danger the issue is whether we can summon the will to do so but the way neocon propaganda works is that the us and its allies are always the victims of some nefarious enemy who must be thwarted to protect all that is good in the world in other words even as ned and other usfunded operations take aim at putin and russia russia and putin must be transformed into the aggressors mr putin would like nothing better than to generate doubts fog cracks and uncertainty around the german pillar of europe the post editorial said he relishes infiltrating chaos and mischief into open societies in this case supporting the farright afd is extraordinarily cynical given how many millions of russians died to defeat the fascists seven decades ago not to belabor the point but there is no credible evidence that putin did any of this there is a claim by the virulently antirussian atlantic council that some anonymous troll accounts promoted some afd complaint about possible voter fraud and that it was picked up by a russianlanguage botnet even if that is true and the atlantic council is far from an objective source where is the link to putinnot everything that happens in russia a nation of 144 million people is ordered by putin but the post would have you believe that it is it is the centerpiece of this neocon conspiracy theorysilencing dissentsimilarly any american who questions this propaganda immediately is dismissed as a kremlin stooge or a russian propagandist another ugly campaign spearheaded by the post and the neocons again no evidence is required just some analysis that what you re saying somehow parallels something putin has saidon tuesday in what amounted to a companion piece for the editorial a post article again pushed the unproven suspicions about russian operatives buying 100000 in facebook ads from 2015 into 2017 to supposedly influence us politics once again no evidence requiredin the article the post also reminds its readers that moscow has a history of focusing on social inequities in the us which gets us back to the comparisons between the old mccarthyism and the newyes it s true that the soviet union denounced america s racial segregation and cited that ugly feature of us society in expressing solidarity with the american civil rights movement and national liberation struggles in africa it s also true that american communists collaborated with the domestic civil rights movement to promote racial integrationthat was a key reason why j edgar hoover s fbi targeted martin luther king jr and other africanamerican leaders because of their association with known or suspected communists similarly the reagan administration resisted support for nelson mandela because his african national congress accepted communist support in its battle against south africa s apartheid whitesupremacist regimeinterestingly one of the arguments from liberal national democrats in opposing segregation in the 1960s was that the repression of american blacks undercut us diplomatic efforts to develop allies in africa in other words soviet and communist criticism of america s segregation actually helped bring about the demise of that offensive systemyet king s association with alleged communists remained a talking point of diehard segregationists even after his assassination when they opposed creating a national holiday in his honor in the 1980sthese parallels between the old mccarthyism and the new mccarthyism are implicitly acknowledged in the post s news article on tuesday which cites putin s criticism of police killings of unarmed american blacks as evidence that he is meddling in us politics since taking office putin has on occasion sought to spotlight racial tensions in the united states as a means of shaping perceptions of american society the article states putin injected himself in 2014 into the race debate after protests broke out in ferguson mo over the fatal shooting of michael brown an african american by a white police officer do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy in the united states putin told cbs s 60 minutes program if everything was perfect there wouldn t be the problem of ferguson there would be no abuse by the police but our task is to see all these problems and respond properly the post s speculative point seems to be that putin s response included having russian operatives buy some ads on facebook to exploit these racial tensions but there is no evidence to support that conspiracy theoryhowever as this antirussia hysteria spreads we may soon see americans who also protest the police killing of unarmed black men denounced as putin s fellowtravelers much as king and other civil rights leaders were smeared as communist dupes ignoring realityso instead of democrats and chancellor merkel looking in the mirror and seeing the real reasons why many white workingclass voters are turning toward populist and extremist alternatives they can simply blame putin and continue a crackdown on internetbased dissent as the work of russian operatives already under the guise of combating russian propaganda and fake news google facebook and other tech giants have begun introducing algorithms to hunt down and marginalize news that challenges official us government narratives on hotbutton issues such as ukraine and syria again no evidence is required just the fact that putin may have said something similaras democrats liberals and even some progressives join in this russiagate hysteria driven by their hatred of donald trump and his supposedly fascistic tendencies they might want to consider whom they ve climbed into bed with and what these neocons have in mind for the futurearguably if fascism or totalitarianism comes to the united states it is more likely to arrive in the guise of protecting democracy from russia or another foreign adversary than from a realitytv clown like donald trumpthe new mccarthyism with its orwellianstyle algorithms might seem like a clever way to neutralize or maybe even help oust trump but long after trump is gone a structure for letting the neocons and the mainstream media monopolize american political debate might be a far greater threat to both democracy and peaceto read more on the new cold war the 21wire cold war filessupport 21wire subscribe

The ‘New Cold War’ – A Rehash of Old Rivalries, what will the new cold war look like illustration by brad hollandwilliam blum ichthe antirussianantisoviet bias in the american media appears to have no limit you would think that they would have enough selfawareness and enough journalistic integrity  just enough  to be concerned about their image but it keeps on coming piled higher and deeperone of the latest cases in point is a review of a new biography of mikhail gorbachev in the new york times book review september 10 the review says that gorbachev was no hero to his own people because he was the destroyer of their empire  this is how the new york times avoids having to say anything positive about life in the soviet union or about socialism they would have readers believe that it was the loss of the likes of czechoslovakia or hungary et al that upset the russian people not the loss under gorbachev s perestroika of a decent standard of living for all a loss affecting people s rent employment vacations medical care education and many other aspects of the soviet welfare stateaccompanying this review is a quote from a 1996 times review of gorbachev s own memoir which said it mystifies westerners that mikhail gorbachev is loathed and ridiculed in his own country this is the man who pulled the world several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing fear from his countrymen who ended bloody foreign adventures and liberated eastern europe yet his repudiation at home could hardly be more complete his political comeback attempt in june attracted less than 1 percent of the vote thus is gorbachev s unpopularity with his own people further relegated to the category of mystery  and not due to the profound social changesit should be noted that in 1999 usa today reported when the berlin wall crumbled 1989 east germans imagined a life of freedom where consumer goods were abundant and hardships would fade ten years later a remarkable 51 say they were happier with communism earlier polls would likely have shown even more than 51 expressing such a sentiment for in the ten years many of those who remembered life in east germany with some fondness had passed away although even 10 years later in 2009 the washington post could report westerners west berliners say they are fed up with the tendency of their eastern counterparts to wax nostalgic about communist times it was in the postunification period that a new russian and eastern europe proverb was born everything the communists said about communism was a lie but everything they said about capitalism turned out to be the truth the current new york times review twice refers to vladimir putin as authoritarian  as does routinely much of the western media none of the many such references i have come across in recent years has given an example of such authoritarian policies although such examples of course exist as they do under a man named trump and a woman named may and every other government in the world but clearly if a strong case could be made of putin being authoritarian the western media would routinely document such in their attacks upon the russian president why do they notthe review further refers to putin to as the coldeye former kgb lieutenant colonel  one has to wonder if the new york times has ever referred to president george hw bush as the coldeye former cia director just as in the first cold war one of the basic problems is that americans have great difficulty in believing that russians mean well apropos this i d like to recall the following written about george kennan one of the most prominent american diplomats evercrossing poland with the first us diplomatic mission to the soviet union in the winter of 1933 a young american diplomat named george kennan was somewhat astonished to hear the soviet escort foreign minister maxim litvinov reminisce about growing up in a village nearby about the books he had read and his dreams as a small boy of being a librarian we suddenly realized or at least i did that these people we were dealing with were human beings like ourselves kennan wrote that they had been born somewhere that they had their childhood ambitions as we had it seemed for a brief moment we could break through and embrace these people it hasn t happened yetkennan s sudden realization brings george orwell to mind we have now sunk to a depth at which the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men the plague of nationalismthe world has enough countries too goddamn many if you ask me is there room for any more delegations at the united nations any more parking spots in new york have the people of catalonia who are seeking independence from spain in an october 1 vote considered that their new nation will have to open hundreds of new embassies and consulates around the world furnish them all fill them all with paid employees houses and apartments and furniture for many of them several new cars for each diplomatic post how many billions of dollars in taxes will be taken from the catalan people to pay for all thisand what about the military any selfrespecting country needs an army and a navy will the new catalonia be able to afford even halfway decent armed forces the new country will of course have to join nato with its obligatory minimum defense capability there goes a billion or two moreplus what it will have to pay the european union which will simply be replacing madrid in imposing many legal restrictions upon the catalan peopleand for what noble purpose are they rising up freedom democracy civil liberties human rights no it s all for money madrid is taking in more in taxes from catalonia than it returns in services something which can be said about many citystate relationships in the united states presumably there are also some individual catalans who have their odd personal reasonscatalan nationalists insist that selfdetermination is an inalienable right and cannot be curbed by the spanish constitution well then why stop with an autonomous community as catalonia is designated why don t provinces everywhere have the right to declare their independence how about cities or neighborhoods why not my block i could be the presidentand there are many other restive independence movements in the world like the kurds in iraq and turkey in scotland belgium and italy and california lord help us many countries are very reluctant to even recognize a new state for fear that it might encourage their own people to break awayif love is blind nationalism has lost all five senses if nature were a bank they would have already rescued it eduardo galeanous treasury secretary steven mnuchin told a new york investor conference that hurricane irma would ultimately boost the economy by sparking rebuilding there clearly is going to be an impact on gdp in the short run we will make it up in the long run as we rebuild that will help gdp it won t have a bad impact on the economy hmmm very interesting can we therefore assume that if the damage had been twice as bad it would have boosted the economy even moremeanwhile in the nontrump nonfantasy world there is a thing called climate change ie the quality of our lives the survival of the planet what keeps corporations from modifying their behavior so as to be kinder to our environment it is of course the good old bottom line again what can we do to convince the corporations to consistently behave like good citizens nothing that hasn t already been tried and failed except one thing unmentionable in polite company unmentionable in a capitalist society nationalization there i said it now i ll be getting letters addressed to the old stalinist but nationalization is not a panacea either at least for the environment there s the greatest single source of manmade environmental damage in the world the united states military and it s already been nationalized but doing away with private corporations will reduce the drive toward imperialism sufficiently that before long the need for a military will fade away and we can live like costa rica if you think that would put the united states in danger of attack please tell me who would attack and whythe argument i like to use when speaking to those who don t accept the idea that extreme weather phenomena are manmade is thiswell we can proceed in one of two ways1 we can do our best to limit the greenhouse effect by curtailing greenhouse gas emissions carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere and if it turns out that these emissions were not in fact the cause of all the extreme weather phenomena then we ve wasted a lot of time effort and money although other benefits to the ecosystem would still accrue2 we can do nothing at all to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and if it turns out that these emissions were in fact the leading cause of all the extreme weather phenomena not simply extreme but getting downright freaky then we ve lost the earth and life as we know itso are you a gamblerthe new vietnam documentaryat the beginning of ken burns new documentary on the american war in vietnam the narrator says the war was begun in good faith by decent people out of fateful misunderstandings american overconfidence and cold war misunderstandings the early american involvement in vietnam can be marked by two things in particular 1 helping the french imperialists in their fight against the forces led by ho chi minh of north vietnam and 2 the cancellation of the elections that would have united north and south vietnam as one nation because the us and its south vietnam allies knew that ho chi minh would win it was that simplenothing of good faith or decency in that scenario no misunderstandings ho chi minh was a great admirer of america and its declaration of independence his own actual declaration of 1945 begins with the familiar all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but ho chi minh was what was called a communist  it was that simple see the vietnam chapter in my book killing hope for the detailsdaniel ellsberg s conclusion about the us in vietnam it wasn t that we were on the wrong side we were the wrong side ms hillaryshe has a new book out and lots of interviews all giving her the opportunity to complain about the many forces that joined together to deny her her rightful place as queen i might feel a bit just a bit of sympathy for the woman if not for her greatest crimethere was a country called libya it had the highest standard of living in all of africa its people had not only free education and health care but all kinds of other benefits that other africans could only dream about it was also a secular state a quality to be cherished in africa and the middle east but moammar gaddafi of libya was never a properly obedient client of washington amongst other shortcomings the man threatened to replace the us dollar with gold for payment of oil transactions create a common african currency and was a strong supporter of the palestinians and foe of israelin 2011 secretary of state hillary clinton was the prime moving force behind the united states and nato turning libya into a failed state where it remains todaythe attack against libya was one that the new york times said clinton had championed  convincing president obama in what was arguably her moment of greatest influence as secretary of state the people of libya were bombed almost daily for more than six months the main excuse given was that gaddafi was about to invade benghazi the libyan center of his opponents and so the united states and nato were thus saving the people of that city from a massacre the american people and the american media of course swallowed this story though no convincing evidence of the alleged impending massacre has ever been presented the nearest thing to an official us government account of the matter a congressional research service report on events in libya for the period makes no mention at all of the threatened massacrethe usnato heavy bombing sent libya crashing in utter chaos leading to the widespread dispersal throughout north african and middle east hotspots of the gigantic arsenal of weaponry that gaddafi had accumulated libya is now a haven for terrorists from al qaeda to isis whereas gaddafi had been a leading foe of terrorists he had declared libya as a barrier to terrorists as well as african refugees going to europe the bombing has contributed greatly to the area s mammoth refugee crisisand when hillary was shown a video about the horrific murder of gaddafi by his opponents she loudly cackled yes that s the word we came we saw he died you can see it on youtubethere s also her support of placing regime change in syria ahead of supporting the syrian government in its struggle against isis and other terrorist groups even more disastrous was the 2003 us invasion of iraq which she as a senator supportedif all this is not sufficient to capture the utter charm of the woman another foreignpolicy adventure one which her swooning followers totally ignore the few that even know about it is the coup ousting the moderately progressive manuel zelaya of honduras in june 2009 a tale told many times in latin america the downtrodden masses finally put into power a leader committed to reversing the status quo determined to try to put an end to two centuries of oppression and before long the military overthrows the democraticallyelected government while the united states if not the mastermind behind the coup does nothing to prevent it or to punish the coup regime as only the united states can punish meanwhile washington officials pretend to be very upset over this affront to democracy district of columbiahow many people around the world know that in washington dc district of columbia where i live the capital city of the united states  the country that is always lecturing the world about this thing called democracy  the citizens do not have the final say over making the laws that determine life in their city many americans as well are not aware of thisaccording to the us constitution section 8 congress has the final say and in recent years has blocked the city from using local tax dollars to subsidize abortion for lowincome women blocked the implementation of legal marijuana use blocked needle exchanges blocked certain taxes blocked a law that says employers cannot discriminate against workers based on their reproductive decisions imposed private schools into the publicschool system and will soon probably block the district s new assistedsuicide law already blocked in the house of representatives on top of all this since dc is not a state its citizens do not have any representatives in the senate and their sole representative in the house has

MSM Fake News: How Washington Post Sexed-up its ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,this is a story about how once trusted mainstream media outlets like washington post and the new york times have used their vast platforms to distort reality and spread disinformation en masse to both the american and global public it s also a story about a new excuse industry which has sprung up to medicate hillary clinton s tragic defeatthe article below written by awardwinning journalist robert parry reveals the shocking extent to which the establishment is willing to go to achieve both domestic political and international geopolitical outcomesin september we were told by multiple us mainstream media that suspected russian operators used facebook and twitter accounts to spread anticlinton messages which somehow affected the electoral outcome in 2016 this was followed by a dramatic announcement by facebook officials that they had responded to the crisis by shutting down several hundred accounts approx 470 suspected to have been created by a firm linked to the kremlin who used russian bot accounts to purchase 100000 worth of facebook post ads 3000 ads in total over a 3 year period that s only 33000 per year which we re told were pushing divisive issues during and after the american election campaign so said the new york timesas it turns out the story was not only wildly exaggerated it provided a convenient smoke screen to coverup another case of real collusionthe scale of american propaganda is simply breathtakingin this single passage taken from the recent new york times scoop on the alleged facebook russian bot phenomenon you can see the full compliment of packaged lies which has become a set piece in us mainstream discourse now the russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of democratic emails or the fire hose of stories true false and in between that battered mrs clinton on russian outlets like rt and sputnik far less splashy and far more difficult to trace was russia s experimentation on facebook and twitter the american companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and in this case did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda it gets worse though what the washington post and others like the new york times have obscured from the american people through this massive propaganda exercise is the obama administration and partisan democrats own role in helping to generate this contrived conspiracy or fake news in the absence of any actual evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia what we have now is a case of silicon valley giant facebook actually colluding with the white house and the federal government officials in order to help fabricate a highly politicized false conviction here are some of the main points in the article below powerful politicians pressured facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling the washington post and others tried to convince a naive portion of the public to believe that somehow 100000 in transient facebook ad impacted the tens of billions of dollars spent during us political spending for the 2016 election cycle with all of the hype about russian operatives the mainstream media has not produced evidence to show who bought the adsas journalistic hoaxes go this is one of the biggest we ve seenperhaps an even bigger fraud in all of this however is how a corporate mainstream media outlet like the washington post can use it s unlimited resources and media might to push out a blatantly fake narrative intentionally distorted to deceive the public in order to achieve some partisan political objective and then site on the board of the establishment s first draft project which they claim is leading the fight against fake news  how can a major purveyor of fake news be left to lead the fight to tackle fake news  this is the danger of allowing an establishment cartel comprising of the corporate media facebook google and other tech monopolies to devise their own information policing regimemore on this incredible story from awardwinning consortium news here   by robert parrysome people are calling the antirussian hysteria being whipped up across the us mainstream news media a new golden age of american journalism although it looks to me more like a new age of yellow journalism prepping the people for more military spending more information warfare and more actual waryes without doubt president trump is a boorish and dangerous demagogue now highlighted by his reckless speech before the united nations last week his schoolyard tweet taunts toward north korean leader kim jong un and his ugly denunciation of black athletes for protesting against police killings of often unarmed africanamericansand yes i know that some people feel that the evidencelite andor false allegations about russian meddling are the golden ticket to trump s impeachment but the unprofessional behavior of the new york times the washington post and pretty much the entire mainstream media regarding russiagate cannot be properly justified by the goal of removing trump from officeethically in journalism the ends however much you might wish them to succeed cannot justify the means if those means involve violating rules of evidence and principles of fairness journalism should be a place where all sides get a fair shake not where some get a bum s rushbut the us mainstream media has clearly joined the antitrump resistance and hates russian president vladimir putin too so we are given such travesties of journalism as appeared as a banner headline across the front page of monday s washington post another screed about how russia supposedly used facebook ads to flip last november s election for trumpthe article purports to give the inside story of how facebook belatedly came to grips with how the company s social network played a key role in the us election but actually it is a story about how powerful politicians bullied facebook into coming up with something anything to support the narrative of russian meddling including direct interventions by president obama and sen mark warner of virginia the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee and a key legislator regarding regulation of hightech industriesfinding the evidence in other words facebook was sent back again and again to find what obama and warner wanted the social media company to find eventually facebook turned up 100000 in ads from 2015 into 2017 that supposedly were traced somehow to russia these ads apparently addressed political issues in america although facebook has said most did not pertain directly to the presidential election and some ads were purchased after the electionleft out of the post s latest opus is what a very small pebble these ads were even assuming that russians did toss the 100000 or so in ad buys into the very large lake of billions of dollars in us political spending for the 2016 election cycle it also amounts to a miniscule fraction of facebook s 27 billion in annual revenueso the assertion that this alleged meddling and we ve yet to see any evidence connecting these ads to the russian government played a key role in the us election is both silly and outrageous especially given the risks involved in stoking animosities between nucleararmed russia and nucleararmed americafacebook colluding with governmenteven the post s alarmist article briefly acknowledges that it is still unclear who bought the ads referring to the purchasers as suspected russian operatives in other words we don t even know that the 100000 in ads over three years came from russians seeking to influence the us election by comparison many facebook advertisers even some small businesses spend 100000 per day on their ads not 100000 over three yearsbut this diminutive effort by suspected russian operatives doesn t stop the post from going on and on about fake news and disinformation albeit again without offering evidence or specifics of any russian fake news or disinformation it has simply become official washington s new groupthink to say that everything linked to russia or its international tv network rt is fake news or disinformation even though examples are lacking or often turn out to be false accusations themselvesfor instance there is nothing in the post s article acknowledging that nothing from the various democratic email disclosures which have been blamed on russia again without real evidence has been identified as untrue so how can truthful information whether you like how it was obtained or not be fake news or disinformation falsehood as factbut monday s post expos simply asserts the claim as flat fact or as the article asserts what russian operatives posted on facebook was for the most part indistinguishable from legitimate political speech the difference was the accounts that were set up to spread the misinformation and hate were illegitimate in responsible journalism such an accusation would be followed by a forinstance giving an example of the misinformation and hate that the russian operatives note how they have been magically transformed from suspected russian operatives to simply russian operatives were disseminatingbut there is no example of the russian misinformation and hate a classic violation of the reporting principle of show don t tell in this story it s all tell and no showindeed what is shown in the article is often contradictory to the story s conclusion the article says for instance a review by the company found that most of the groups behind the problematic pages had clear financial motives which suggested that they weren t working for a foreign government but amid the mass of data the company was analyzing the security team did not find clear evidence of russian disinformation or ad purchases by russianlinked accounts so facebook initially after extensive searching did not find evidence of a russian operation then after continued pressure from highlevel democrats facebook continued to scour its system and again found nothing or as the post article acknowledged facebook had searched extensively for evidence of foreign purchases of political advertising but had come up short that prompted warner to fly out to silicon valley to personally press facebook executives to come up with the evidence to support the democrats theory about russia paying for carefully targeted anticlinton ads in key districtsthe post s article reported that finally facebook chief security officer alex stamos appealed to warner for help if us intelligence agencies had any information about the russian operation or the troll farms it used to disseminate misinformation they should share it with facebook the company is still waiting people involved in the matter said under pressurestill faced with extraordinary pressure from senior democrats facebook finally delivered the desired results or as the post reported by early august facebook had identified more than 3000 ads addressing social and political issues that ran in the united states between 2015 and 2017 and that appear to have come from accounts associated with the st petersburg russiabased internet research agency so the ads covering three years including postelection 2017 only appear to be associated with some private russian operation that only allegedly has ties to the kremlin and the total sums of the ad buys are infinitesimal compared to what it actually takes to have any real impact on facebook or in a us presidential electionif the context of this story were changed slightly say it was about the us government trying to influence public opinion in another country which actually does happen quite a bit the post would be among the first news outlets to laugh off such allegations or dismiss the vague accusations as a conspiracy theory but since these allegations fit with the prejudices of the post s editors an entirely different set of journalistic standards is appliedwhat the article also ignores is the extraordinary degree of coercion that such highlevel political pressure can put on a company that recognizes its vulnerability to government regulationas facebook has acknowledged in corporate filings action by governments to restrict access to facebook in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook in their country restrict access to facebook from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of facebook in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely in the event that access to facebook is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected avoiding realityin other words another way to have framed this story is that powerful politicians who could severely harm facebook s business model were getting in the face of facebook executives and essentially demanding that they come up with something to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling the democratic leaders wanted this finding as an explanation for hillary clinton s image left stunning defeat rather than going through the painful process of examining why the party has steadily lost ground in white workingclass areas across the countrywhat is missed in these russiabashing articles is that the democratic brand has been sinking for years including massive losses in statehouses across the country as well as in congress the party s decline was not a oneoff event with donald trump suddenly snaking away with significant parts of the white working class because the russians bought some facebook adshowever instead of looking in the mirror national democrats demanded that facebook executives ferret out whatever tiny or imaginary information there might be about some russians buying facebook ads and then allow those coerced findings to be fed into the excuse industry for why hillary clinton lostand what about the post s repeated accusations about russia engaging in disinformation and fake news without offering a single example apparently these assertions have become such articles of faith in the us mainstream media that they don t require any proofhowever honest journalism demands examples and evidence not just vague accusations the reality is that the us government has stumbled again and again when seeking to paint rt as a disinformation outlet or a vehicle for undermining american democracyfor instance the jan 6 report on alleged russian cyber operations released by obama s director of national intelligence james clapper included a lengthy appendix dated from 2012 which decried rt for such offenses as allowing a debate among thirdparty presidential candidates who had been excluded from the republicandemocratic debates covering the occupy wall street protests and citing the environmental dangers from fracking the idea that american democracy is threatened by allowing thirdparty candidates or other american dissidents to have a voice is at best an upsidedown understanding of democracy and more likely an exercise in hypocritical propagandafalse accusationsanother misfired attempt to discredit rt came from obama s under secretary of state for public diplomacy richard stengel who issued a dipnote in april 2014 which helped establish the narrative of rt as a source of russian disinformationfor instance stengel claimed that rt reported a ludicrous assertion that the united states had spent 5 billion to produce ukraine s regime change in february 2014but what stengel a former managing editor of time magazine apparently failed to understand was that rt was referring to a public speech by assistant secretary of state for european affairs victoria nuland to us and ukrainian business leaders on dec 13 2013 in which she told them that we have invested more than 5 billion in what was needed for ukraine to achieve its european aspirations in other words the rt report wasn t ludicrous at allnuland also was a

Undercutting the Nation State? Chicago Group Suggests ‘Global Cities’ Should Run World Affairs,mark anderson truth houndchicago ill the disruptive forces changing cities program conducted by the chicago council of global affairs sept 15 was a textbook case of an elite organization pursuing a tightly planned dictatorial society while sounding like it s seeking a democratic promising vision of fairness and prosperity for allit s all being spearheaded in accordance with the growing global cities movement that gradually challenges the authority of the very nationstates that the world s primary cities inhabitthis approach according to several ccgaaligned think tanks journalists and others supporting the global parliament of mayors and similar groupings amounts to a direct challenge to national authority in order to usurp some of the key powers delegated to national governments by their charters and constitutionssince this movement chisels away at the constitutional foundations of nations it risks undermining them in a way that would redraw the lines of governance in a manner that s highly unpredictable and potentially radical and unlawful the policy areas over which cities want to assume much more influence and ultimately exert control include battling climate change regulating immigration in order to increase it while providing sanctuary cities along with sparking job growth and several other things even including the seemingly improbable realm of foreign policy where you d think mayors would not treadthe ccga s latest program sept 15 held ontherecord at the organization s conference center in the prudential building on randolph street was a continuation of many of the themes covered in early june 2016 and june 2017 at the ccga s annual allday forum on global cities the keynote speaker sept 15 was amy liu who s vice president and director of the metropolitan policy program at washington dc s brookings institutionshe s considered a national expert on cities and metropolitan areas adept at translating research and insights into action on the ground as director of brookings metro which liu cofounded in 1996 she pioneered the program s signature approach to policy and practice which uses rigorous research to inform strategies for economic growth and opportunity a ccga representative said while introducing liu in chicagoprior to her brookings work liu was special assistant to us housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros and staffed the us senate banking committee s subcommittee on housing and urban affairs she holds a northwestern university degree in social policy and urban studiesher remarks were promoted via the ccga website with statements like cities are increasingly driving the global economy but numerous disruptive forces    threaten to deepen inequality and economic exclusion unless cities adapt and evolve and while liu spoke of the choices that municipal leaders will need to make in order to give their workforces access to basic things like skills and to foster innovation and entrepreneurship while deepening regional connections  the key to understanding her message is discerning what she and the ccga mean by global forces of disruption to address such matters liu spoke solo and then collaborated with ccga moderator niamh king who prior to joining the ccga worked for the european commission and the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia among several other postsliu began her talk by saying she wants cities to be vibrant places to work and live but due to america s current national discourse under president trump we are turning our backs on climate change on the poor and the working class while also betraying our values as a nation of immigrants moreover people of all races and religions are being neglected under this national discourse so rather than take us backwards the nation needs our cities to move us forward liu carefully stated presenting a thinlyveiled claim that the nationstate especially a more nationalist one represents a barrier to what internationalistoriented cities can dothus the world s cities in essence need to run their nations she implied accordingly she called for a future that s hyperglobal more digital more urban more multiracial and multiethnic but her concern is that these very same forces of progress can also be great sources of division technology for example creates opportunities for some but destroys it for others favoring the highlyskilled while abandoning those who cannot keep paceto combat such disparities liu stressed that local leaders need to build inclusive local and regional economies that radically adapt to disruption and futureproof our cities citing her brookings work she said cities therefore should pursue three goals growth prosperity and inclusion that she added means quality growth of good jobs to seek better prosperity but to achieve this inclusion the benefits especially in terms of better incomes must accrue to all members of the community closing disparities by race and by place she also said that 63 us metro areas out of 100 experienced economic growth and job hikes between 2010 and 2015 according to brookings research but several cities only saw growth in lesserquality jobs while only eight made significant economic progress in inclusion for whites and people of color liu also stressed the nation s economic growth is not felt by most people    as a whole the bottom 50 of incomeearners the middle class the working class the poor have made no ground so the bulk of the nation s income gains have accrued to the top earners from this she concluded that it s up to the cities to bridge these gaps and solve the problemsliu then cited historic policies and attitudes that she feels have held us back in tackling such inequities accordingly at this point she delved into the disruptive forces facing cities and how city leaders can adapt to disruption doublespeak detectedironically liu spoke of these disruptive forces which are mainly macroeconomic in nature as if they re akin to the four horsemen of the apocalypse globalization urbanization technology and demographic change which she warned are upending existing systems she went on to say that while globalization has supposedly slowed down free trade is going strong accounting for 40 of world economic value trade she deduced from this has tremendous economic value because firms that export their wares hire more people and pay better wages than nonexporting firms yet while downplaying the immense damage free trade has wrought lest groupings like brookings and the ccga lose the narrative in their constant support for more freetrade treaties she admitted that us voters in the last election made it clear that globalization has left many without jobs for extended time periodsshowing a colorcoded map she also said that federal adjustment assistance has been extended to more than two million americans in the past two decades those whose jobs were terminated due to trade with 70 of such workers living in large and small metropolitan areas the trade pain was most felt in the industrial communities in the midwest and the south she also concededbending people to the system not vice versabut the crux of the matter shone through when she stated i would say that the problem isn t so much globalization but the failure of our public policies to help people and to help communities adjust to the new world order continue this article at the truth houndread more nwo news at 21st century

"Trump Bares Himself at UNGA, “In a Kind of Neocon Full Monte”", president trump speaking at the unga photo screenshotrobert parry consortium newsin discussing president trump there is always the soft prejudice of low expectations people praise him for reading from a teleprompter even if his words make little sense but there is no getting around the reality that his maiden address to the united nations general assembly must rank as one of the most embarrassing moments in america s relations with the global communitytrump offered a crude patchwork of propaganda and bluster partly delivered as a campaign speech praising his own leadership boasting about the relatively strong us economy that he mostly inherited from president obama and partly reflecting his continued subservience to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahuhowever perhaps most importantly trump s speech may have extinguished any flickering hope that his presidency might achieve some valuable course corrections in how the united states deals with the world ie shifting away from the disastrous warinterventionist policies of his two predecessorsbefore the speech there was at least some thinking that his visceral disdain for the neoconservatives who mostly opposed his nomination and election might lead him to a realization that their policies toward iran iraq syria and elsewhere were at the core of america s repeated and costly failures in recent decadesinstead apparently after a bracing lecture from netanyahu on monday trump bared himself in a kind of neocon full monte he repeated the israelineocon tripe about iran destabilizing the middle east when shiiteruled iran actually has helped stabilize iraq and syria against sunni terrorist groups and other militants supported by saudi arabia and to a degree israel he again denounced the iranian nuclear agreement whose main flaw in the eyes of the israelis and the neocons is that it disrupted their plans to bombbombbomb iran and he called for regime change in iran a long beloved dream of the israelis and the neocons he repeated the israelineocon propaganda about hezbollah as a terrorist organization when hezbollah s real crime was driving the israeli military out of southern lebanon in 2000 ending an israeli occupation that began with israel s 1982 invasion he praised his rushtojudgment decision to bomb syria last april in line with israelineocon propaganda against president bashar alassad and partly out of a desire to please the same washington establishment that is still scheming how to impeach him he spoke with the crass hypocrisy that the neocons and many israeli leaders have perfected particularly his demand that all nations respect the rights of every other sovereign nation when he made clear that he like his white house predecessors is ready to violate the sovereignty of other nations that get in official washington s waya litany of warsjust this century the united states has invaded multiple nations without un authorization based on various coalitions of the willing and other subterfuges for wars of aggression which the nuremberg tribunals deemed the supreme international crime and which the un was specifically created to preventnot only did president george w bush invade both afghanistan and iraq while also sponsoring antiterror operations in many other countries but president barack obama acknowledged ordering military attacks in seven countries including against the will of sovereign states such as libya and syria obama also supported a violent coup against the elected government of ukrainefor his part trump already has shown disdain for international law by authorizing military strikes inside yemen and syria in other words if not for the fear of provoking american anger many of the world s diplomats might have responded with a barrage of catcalls toward trump for his blatant hypocrisy without doubt the united states is the preeminent violator of sovereignty and international law in the world today yet trump wagged his finger at others including russia over ukraine and china over the south china seahe declared we must reject threats to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow then with a seeming blindness to how much of the world sees the united states as a law onto itself trump added the scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based of course in the us mainstream media s commentary that followed trump s hypocrisy went undetected that s because across the american politicalmedia establishment the us right to act violently around the world is simply accepted as the way things are supposed to be international law is for the other guy not for the indispensible nation not for the sole remaining superpower on bibi s leashdespite some of his america first rhetoric tossed in as red meat to his base trump revealed a global outlook that differed from the bushobama neoconservativeliberalinterventionist approach in words only in substance trump appears to be just the latest american poodle on bibi netanyahu s leashfor instance trump bragged about attacking syria over a dubious chemicalweapons claim while ignoring the role of the saudiisraeli tandem in assisting al qaeda and its syrian affiliate trump threatened the international nuclear agreement with iran while calling for regime change in tehran two of netanyahu s top priorities and trump warned that he would totally destroy north korea over its nuclear and missile programs while making no mention of israel s rogue nuclear arsenal and sophisticated delivery capabilitiesignoring saudi arabia s ties to terrorism trump touted his ludicrous summit in riyadh in which he danced with swords and let king salman and other corrupt persian gulf monarchs who have long winked and nodded at ideological and logistical support going to al qaeda and other islamic terror groups pretend their governments were joining an antiterror coalitionexploding the myth that he is at least a streetsmart operator who can t be easily conned trump added in saudi arabia early last year i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 arab and muslim nations we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires them no wonder netanyahu seemed so pleased with trump s speech the israeli prime minister could have written it himself while allowing trump to add a few crude flourishes like calling north korean leader kim jong un rocket man on a suicide mission  referring to the loser terrorists  and declaring that many parts of the world are going to hell trump also tossed in a plug for his new strategy for victory in afghanistan and threw in some interventionist talk regarding the western hemisphere with more threats to cuba and venezuela about escalating sanctions and other activities to achieve more regime change solutionsso what trump made clear in his un address is that his america first and prosovereignty rhetoric is simply cover for a set of policies that are indistinguishable from those pushed by the neocons of the bush administration or the liberal interventionists of the obama administration the rationalizations may change but the endless wars and regime change machinations continue watch trump s full speech here  read more trump news at 21st century wire trump

What a Wonderful World – US Saviour Complex,bruno guigue 21st century wirepurveyor of platitudes the west portrays itself as the epitome of universal values  a paragon of democracy this champion of human rights always deploys its presumed virtues in support of its hegemonic ambitions like the fairy godmother doing her best to match her morals with her interests she veils her ambitions with the cloak of law and justice thus the free world goes about bombing foreign nations for the sake of democracy  preferably in oil or mineralrich territories by combining a simple creed with capitalist greed it is acting as if it can convert its economic supremacy into moral privilegethe rest of the world is not fooled by these tactics but who cares the free world is always right because it represents the good fight and for as long as it is the most powerful it will not be contradicted the inherent barbarism that it projects onto others is the counter to its selfproclaimed monopoly on civilization sanctified by the holy order of right to intervene  a marriage of the gi sandbags with the kouchnerstyle bag of rice the west vassalized by washington believes wholeheartedly that they can save the world by subjugating it to the pitiless ravages demanded by the financial vultures and military industrial complexthis supremacist enterprise was not born yesterday it was midwived in the historical period dear to fernand braudel that of the emergence of the world economy driven by its superior technological advances since the renaissance the western world has propelled itself towards the conquest of our planet earth patiently the west has appropriated other cultures other worlds and twisted them into its own image enforcing obeissance and imitation eliminating all those who would not conform its certitude is untroubled by its own hypocrisy the west perceives itself as a metaphor for this world the west wanted to expand from being a part of the world into being the whole in the same way today we see countries comprising 10 of the world s population portraying themselves as the international community over the last three centuries colonial conquest has demonstrated the west s desire to expand its influence beyond its own boundaries under the banner of bringing civilization to the underdeveloped this global domination project was temporarily derailed by the uprising of the colonized peoples in the 20th century but it made a triumphant return with its north american branch of hegemonyamerica the far west discovered by christopher columbus in search of the far east  inherited the old continent penchant for imperialism and rapacious carpetbaggery the us converted its lack of history into the promise of a better future  emerging suddenly from anglosaxon puritanism the us magnified the globalist for profit ethos paid for with the blood of the americanindian genocide america was born the newly minted metaphor for the worldit is not certain that this change was for the better colonial empires collapsed under the weight of their archaic structures while us hegemony maintains itself through modern technology channels from google to drone warfare suddenly the us was the most supple and resilient what imbues it with flexibility also ensures its longevity from the white pith helmet of the european colonial overlords to the digital screens of us cyber warfare a revolution took place the us substituted a shockcolonization dismantled after bloody decolonization conflict with a multifaceted hegemonic enterprise taking over from the classic colonial three m s the made in the us ngos replaced the christian missionary complex merchants became multinationals and the soldiers converted to cyber supremacyemboldened by the diehard spirit of born again midwesterners the american empire is projecting its devastating manichaeism upon the rest of the world dreaming with its eyes wide open the us envisages a definitive alliance between good and evil the indestructible pillar upon which to build a straightforward ethnocentrism the law is on their side as it embodies the core values of democracy human rights and market economy  obviously this is a crude ideology a fraudulent mask for its own sordid interests but it is effective its efficacy is proven by the popular consensus that the us won the second world war capitalism works cuba is a tropical gulag assad is worse than hitler and that north korea is a threat to the world this process of selfbeatification bestows upon the northamericanempire zealots the right to track down all evil in the world no scruples will impede its saviour frenzy it is the very incarnation of such an exceptional civilization  that it must cleanse the world of barbarism by all means at its disposal that is why modern imperialism functions as a court of universal law a judge that rewards or punishes where it sees fit before this elevated moral jurisdiction the cia represents the prosecution the pentagon is the secular chamber the us president is the high court judge a deus ex machina  invoking divine justice the lightning strike upon the axis of evil and any other sinners circulating in the court of the empire of good this tendency for the us to see itself as the moral compass for the world is central to this structure and is unperturbed by the rapid turnaround of presidents in the white house a

Jimmy Carter: ‘Koreans Want Peace Treaty to Replace 1953 Ceasefire’,21st century wire says reframing the current diplomatic crisis in north korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situationformer us president jimmy carter is suggesting just that but will the hawks in washington listen the carter centerthe harsh rhetoric from washington and pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the united states and north korea in addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric our leaders need to encourage talks between north korea and other countries especially china and russia the recent un security council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help in all cases a nuclear exchange must be avoided all parties must assure north koreans they we will forego any military action against them if north korea remains peacefulpresident jimmy carteri have visited north korea three times and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect usdprk relationsin june 1994 i met with kim il sung in a time of crisis when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the international atomic energy agency and to seek mutual agreement with the united states on a permanent peace treaty to have summit talks with the president of south korea to expedite the recovery of the remains of american service personnel buried in his country and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula kim il sung died shortly after my visit and his successor kim jong il notified me and leaders in washington that he would honor the promises made by his father these obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in geneva by robert gallucci and other representatives of the clinton administrationi returned to pyongyang in august 2010 at the invitation of north korean leaders to bring home aijalon gomes an american who had been detained there my last visit to north korea was in may 2011 when i led a delegation of elders former presidents of ireland and finland and former prime minister of norway to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy peopleduring all these visits the north koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the united states and their neighbors but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country they wanted a peace treaty especially with america to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the korean war in 1953 and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period they have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any american attack the influence of china in pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since kim jong un became the north korean leader in december 2011a commitment to peace by the united states and north korea is crucialwhen this confrontational crisis is ended the united states should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953 the united states should make this clear to north koreans and to our alliesread more north korea news at 21st century wire north korea filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,US_News,7-Sep-17,0
"Message for Progressive Left: ‘If You Want to See Real Nazis, Come to Ukraine’",ever since last month the us media and the left wing politicians have been up in arm about alleged rise of nazism in america by now the coverage has been incessant and beyond hysterical as pundits and antifascist activists claim that a viable white supremacist movement is threatening to take over the country which is a mediadriven alternative reality what america s mainstream media establishment will not mention is the us government s own role particularly that of the obama administration and hillary clinton s state department and funded by her campaign financier george soros in helping to fuel the scourge of nazism in eastern europe in the ukraine likewise republicans and socalled conservatives will not want to mention party luminary senator john mccain s own personal role in promoting ukraine s far right parties and helping shoehorn them into power in 2014 after a successful usbacked coup d etat and putsch and the disastrous junta which has followedthe following open letter was posted by aleksandr gontar from donetsk in eastern ukraine skillfully articulates the current farce in the united states and the feigned righteous indignation from the progressive left over the recent staged political altercation in charlottesville virginia i always considered myself as a person with leftwing views but looking at what is happening in the us i can t escape the thought that the american left in its majority is the dumbest and most useless comrade on the planet as a minimum to profess liberal views and at the same time to call oneself leftist is a bit sillythe desperate fight of american comrades against nazis in general is comical they are shocked by a torchlight procession in charlottesville while regular torch processions in the capital of ukraine which they so fervently support in its fight for democracy  don t shock them i speak as well about simple redblue rainbow plankton as well as about the famous fighters against oppression a la tom morello whom i respect as a musician and other celebrities cosplaying che guevara with a red star on the cap a nightmare nazis are in america they hoisted the colors of the confederates and shaved their heads oh my god  american nazis are the same clowns as american anti fascists  by the waykids come into the ukraine we will show you nazis real ones who kill people kill massively proceeding from the racial theory they kill in savage ways like the ss did in the 40 s we will show you a whole state that erects monuments to the ideologists and performers of the holocaust of jewish riots of the genocide of poles who sweep away monuments to the liberators of mankind from nazism a state with a nazi ministry of truth repressions against dissent promotion of racial hatred in schools on tv in children s books a state in which the ministry of internal affairs supervises a website that incites the committing of murder of unreliable citizens openly publishing all their personal information as well as members of their familiesso when you will have such things in america we will talk when you have instead of a car crashing into a crowd of antifascists these antifascists like cattle are herded into the local house of trade unions and will be burned with molotov cocktails finishing off with steel poles those who try to escape when the fbi creates a website on which it will publish the addresses of those who criticize trump and the white race and the organized altright will start to go to these addresses who after your murder will be called patriots and will be released so then we will believe in your whining about nazisand for now suck on it mr american antifasciststhis letter was originally published at stalker zone translated by ollie richardson and angelina siardread more alt right news at 21st century wire alt right filessupport our work by subscribing  becoming a member 21wiretv,US_News,5-Sep-17,0
Trump Springs the Neocon Trap  Again: North Korea’s ‘Test’ is No Act of War,patrick henningsen 21st century wirehere we go again there seems to be no end to the escalation of tensions between north korea and the united states and its alliesyesterday pyongyang s state broadcaster came out declaring what it claims is another successful test  this time with a hydrogen bomb which they say could be mounted on to their still as yet nonexistent intercontinental ballistic missile icbmseizing the moment state news anchor ri chun hee proudly announced that the test was a perfect success and symbolises the country s final step on the long road to attaining a state nuclear force all very excitingstill there has been no independent verification of the claim but why let that get in the way of a promising international security crisis kim jung un looking at shiny objects pointing generally looking busy north korea s alleged test is said to have happened just hours after pyongyang staterun media released images of leader kim jong un inspecting looking pointing something which looks like it could be a hydrogen bomb but no one is really surewe re also told that this was ready to be placed on top of an icbm however no one has actually seen a real operational icbm yet that s kind of an important detail in this grand plot but one which is routinely overlooked by legions of western mainstream experts on cnn and nbc so far the dprk only has a series of botched tests of their shortrange hwasong12 rockets glorified scud missiles to show the world still the western media insist that this constitutes a potential threat to the usso confident was this mainstream media outlet that they ve seemed to have hedged their bets on the authenticity of the dprk state claims leaving the offending h bomb in quotes see also north korea and the unintended consequences of trumpthis wouldn t be the first time north korea exaggerated its wmd credentials last january they exaggerated claims of a successful hbomb test despite their dodgy record the western media and politicians who are fed by defense contracts are lapping up pyongyang s latest pig s breakfastwhatever this latest test was it s hardly an act of war meanwhile south korea wasted no time retaliating by showing off its new toys purchased out of its us dollar reserve account launching multiple missiles for the cameras seoul insists that it s ready to activate four terminal high altitude area defense thaad missile batteries it also carried out a major joint drill likely preplanned anyway with f15k fighter jets and surfacetosurface ballistic missiles this posturing by south korea has excited the western media to no end everyone is loving it because nothing brings eye balls and ratings like a good crisisguardian reporter justin mccurry confirms south korea has carried out a simulated attack on north korea s nuclear test site in a huge show of force in response to pyongyang s detonation of what it claims is a hydrogen bombseoul has also approved the complete deployment of a us antimissile system in another sign that it intends to address north korean provocations with reminders of its own military firepower while keeping the door open to dialogue you can be certain that cnn absolutely loves this latest crisis too wailing this morning south korea strengthened the deployment of a controversial usmade missile defense system and launched a huge show of military might on monday in response to north korea s hydrogen bomb test naturally not a word of condemnation from the western media about south korea s real provocations broadcast in colour around the worldhow serious is the threatat the time of publishing this piece members of the un security council are already convening emergency sessions about what to do next in the final analysis there will have to be some clear and present threat in order to justify some harsh response from the unsccan such a rational evaluation be made with so much theatre on both sideswashington s un ambassador nikki haley gave a predictable hawkish speech claiming that he is begging for war of course haley is all too eager to obligeonce again western media outlets are treating claims by north korea s staterun kcna media agency as good as gold ratings gold that isfor the us this latest move by north korea has been pr gold it s helped to revive and reenergize the dying conversation of a nuclear standoff between the good guys and the bad guys and to deal with those bad guys you need tough guysenter us treasury secretary steven

donald j trump realdonaldtrump september 3 2017toughestof course trump s comments appear to be winding up pyongyang a vicious circle of fighting talk are there any adults left in the roomnot to be outdone here comes a good cop enter us defense secretary james mad dog mattis who is still earning his nickname meant to resemble an unstable rabid house pet after his meeting with president trump and vice president mike pence on sunday the mad dog wearing a purple tie the same colour as hillary s revolution read his military decree on the white house lawn we have many military options and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them we made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies south korea and japan from any attack and our commitments among the allies are ironclad said mattiswhat a relief he sounds moderate compared to trump but wait before exiting the podium he said we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country namely north korea but as i said we have many options to do so this is a unique breed of lunatictalking tough and talking of options for annihilating a country normal people would say this is an idiotic proposition because the fallout would be much worse than any of kim apocalyptic sabre rattling all this looks very familiar quite simply what we are seeing here in washington is neoconservativism reasserting itself through one of its flagship planks the preemptive strike above all other military strategies this is always the most favorable for the pentagon because it doesn t require any real justification or accountability for a preemptive action all that s required is a sufficient amount of media fearmongering and political hype about the threat we all face and how we must act and then simply fire away and sift through the rubble reforming the narrative afterwards in the meantime the ruling parties can call it a success and claim that many lives were saved by this valiant action etc it s clean and straightforward albeit in the short term but extremely messy in the long termas much as hawks in washington would love to test out their new toys right now a conflagration is not likely to happen by the hand of the us in the pacific rim there are too many powerful players in the immediate vicinity south korea japan china taiwan philippines and russia too and the fallout from any rash usled geopolitical pissing contest surgical or kinetic action could be detrimental to all parties better to get someone else to start it for them but that s not easy eitherthere was a time when people had high hopes for mattis he was affectionately referred to as the warrior monk with many fox news pundits drooling over his apparent sun tzu prowess as was rumoured that he has actually read some historical books and was really smart and really wise apparently a rarity in washington military circles these days but no matter how many books people think he s read about the peloponnesian wars it s should be pretty clear by now that mattis like his predecessor ash carter is acting as kind of an executive sales rep for the military industrial complex that s essentially what the position of defense secretary has become in america it s a straightforward deal you ll keep your job as long as you do and say what s required to keep international tensions high at all times this translates into profits and shareholder dividends for industry stakeholders if you re not with the program then you ll have to tender your resignation just ask chuck hagelwhat americans should really understand is that the generals with whom trump is so enamored and who he trusts with all our bombs and silos have left nothing but a string of military failures in their wake between generals james mattis and major general hr mcmaster you have a collective 30 plus years and two of the worst military and foreign policy boondoggles in us history afghanistan and iraq underscored by successive failed surges add to these a total defeat in syria blowing billions of us taxpayer dollars on a proxy war that s arguably created a new generation of islamist extremists although no one will admit it impressive isn t it so why do the media continue to elevate the military brass not every general is a good general as with any other position or profession some are good and some are corrupt and many are incompetent or promoted for playing ball general david petraeus is a good example of this the media can t get enough of him he was the architect of the surge we re told which means he was around when obamabush ordered up another 30000 troops for iraq in a futile effort to fix what they broke still the media will bend over backwards in an almost worshipful mode whenever his name is mentioned forgetting that petraeus was found guilty of the same crime for which half of america wanted hillary clinton lockedup despite bringing his name and his office into disrepute petraeus was rewarded board positions with mega wall street firms like kkr and a perennial seat at bilderbergmen like mattis mcmaster and petraeus can and will run rings around this president who has already signaled his weakness for those chevrons on the shoulder andthis president will happily defer everything to these men should we be surprised if they keep getting it wronglet s just pray that they don t get it wrong with north korea

"SYRIA, NORTH KOREA: Trump’s “Axis of Evil” is Bigger and Better than the George Bush Version",whitney webb mint pressbush s axis of evil speech in 2002 was precursor to disastrous invasion and regime change now once again under trump that narrative has reemerged this time linking syria with north korea based on allegations by unidentified parties regarding chemical weapons shipmentson monday reuters published a widely circulated story based on a confidential united nations report on north korean sanctions violations according to the report which is not available to the general public two north korean shipments to a syrian government agency responsible for the country s chemical weapons program had been interceptedthe report according to reuters was authored by a panel of independent un experts and investigates alleged dealings between a north korean company and syria s scientific studies and research center ssrc a government agency that oversaw the nation s chemical weapons program before the internationallyrecognized destruction of that program took place in 2013notably the 37page document at no point gives details on when or where the interdictions occurred or details regarding what the shipments actually containedthe report further states that its account of the incident s occurrence is dependent on the testimony of two unidentified member states which interdicted shipments destined for syria and had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a komid contract with syria komid is the korea mining development trading corporation a pyongyangbased company the un had previously cited in 2009 when the un security council had it blacklisted for its role in supporting north korea s ballistic missile program as a primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons north korea is caught sending chemical weapons to syria amid concerns kim jongun and assad are working together httpstcoectij2jwn9 daily mail us dailymail august 22 2017north korea chemical weapons said intercepted en route to syria httpstcowdjzolgg8k via timesofisrael northkorea syria gregory smith gsmittysmith august 22 2017with their identities concealed there is no way of knowing if these member states are among the countries that have actively been pushing for the removal of syria s democraticallyelected president bashar alassad since the syrian conflict began in 2011 in addition another member state a nation not involved in the seizure of the shipments had informed the panel that it had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a komid contract with syria it appears that the statement made by this member state s representative was given by this ostensibly independent panel the same weight normally reserved for concrete evidenceit also remains unclear how the ssrc was determined to be the recipient of the intercepted shipments as the report simply states that the consignees were syrian entities designated by the european union and the united states as front companies for the ssrc with only reuters permitted access to this confidential report there is no way to know who or what these entities are as reuters left them unnamed in its articlefurthermore the composition of the un panel itself is also unknown though reuters stated that the panel was composed of independent experts reuters has also previously claimed that organizations such as the syrian observatory for human rights sohr were objective in the syrian conflict even though the sole person behind the group is rabidly antiassad prowestern intervention and reporting on syria from britain shielding the names of these independent experts from the public does little to lend credibility to the findings of this un reportthe north koreasyria arms connection narrativethe north koreasyria arms trade connection is not new this narrative first emerged earlier this year in april when the syrian government stood accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in idlib an event that was later roundly debunked by independent experts including professor emeritus at the massachusetts institute of technology mit and former scientist with the us department of defense theodore postolat the time several us publications including usa today and defense one backed up their claims of sinister cooperation between the syrian and north korean governments by citing professor bruce bechtol of angelo state university texas both outlets described bechtol as a north korea expert but bechtol s evidence cited in these reports such as when he asserts that i would be stunned i would be surprised if the nerve agent allegedly used by the assad regime on april 4 in the idlib province was not supplied by north korea amounts to conjecture bechtol who once worked for the defense intelligence agency and has longstanding links to the pentagon had previously authored a 2015 research paperon the north korea and syrian partnership in which he drew heavily on the cia for his sweeping assertions regarding the two nations alleged long history of collaboration in the production and development of chemical weaponsbechtol s conclusions are undermined by data from the stockholm international peace research institute sipri a recognized authority on the global weapons trade shows that syria has ordered weapons from north korea only three times since 1990 twice in 1990 and once in 1996 in other words syria according to sipri has not made any purchases from north korea in over 20 yearsgiven that arms deals with north korea s government were legal until 2006 and deals with komid were legal until 2009 if the partnership was really so longstanding and prolific why were there so few transactions between them in the years prior the established facts hardly fit the picture of a supposedly booming north koreasyria arms tradecreating the new axis of evil ultimately the attempts to link north korea to syria s defunct chemical weapons program are meant to create a new axis of evil by associating one evil dictator with another the axis of evil narrative first coined by george w bush in 2002 has been central to the us demonization of rogue governments that fail to submit to the usdominated global order of which the united nations is part this narrative has often been followed by the evil dictator label as it was with iraq and libya two of the countries comprising the original axis of evil under trump the axis of evil is having a resurgence a development that even mainstream media outlets like cnn have noted with iraq and libya having been dealt with syria has joined the list and a concerted effort is now being made to link the remaining evil dictators to each other by connecting north korea to syria s thoroughly demonized though nonexistent chemical weapons program the us is building the momentum and the justification for the preventative invasions of these rogue states it has long sought to

AFGHANISTAN: Trump Surges Into the Graveyard of Empires, by ramping up us troop levels in afghanistan trump is alienating many supporters photo dodusaf tech sgt brigitte n brantley source wikicommonsmiles elliot 21st century wireon monday night us president donald trump made a speech in which he outlined his longawaited new strategy for the war in afghanistan as predicted by 21wire in july trump will undertake a fourth us surge in afghanistan building up us troop levels in the country just like bush and obama did before himhowever to say that he outlined a new strategy in his speech is being very kind to trump he did very little outlining and what he did present does not exactly qualify as new or as a strategyone of the most notable features of his speech was his refusal to disclose troop numbers or timescales for their deployment granted publicising those aspects of the us presence in afghanistan did not create a win for obama the former president promised to pull out all the troops by 2014 but left office in january 2017 with over 8500 us military personnel still stationed in the country for trump to keep such details from the american public particularly the troop numbers goes against basic democratic principles of transparency and accountability as finian cunningham says america s overseas wars are not just expanding under trump they are going secret and unaccountable furthermore simply sending more troops and beefing up military deployments to afghanistan is not a new strategy george w bush deployed a quiet surge to afghanistan in 2008 and obama presided over two separate surges in early and late 2009 none of which won the war see 21wire s recent article which points out fundamental flaws and problems with the us strategy and modus operandi in afghanistan doubling down on these flaws with more personnel money and weapons may only amplify themthe war was probably unwinnable from the outset anyway there is a reason afghanistan is referred to as the graveyard of empires justin raimondo s latest article responding to trump s announcement alludes to it so i studied afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle trump claims really did he study it enough to realize that no one has ever conquered afghanistan did he contemplate the storied history of that unforgiving land which caused even alexander the great to turn back or for a more lighthearted approach the following tweet plays on the seeming endlessness of the afghan war in american political lifei made this political cartoon in 2010 enjoy httpstcofsosagurcw pictwittercomjyfqizofzy matt bors mattbors august 22 2017another interesting feature of trump s speech was its focus on pakistan which he sharply criticized for harboring terrorists and allowing them safe havens  however as michael krieger points out in his excellent analysis guess which country he didn t mention the greatest sponsor of islamic radicalization the world has ever seen saudi arabia this once again proves that trump represents the same old tired thinking that s been running the us economy and society into the ground for decades this is now a 100 establishment presidency which will be completely defined by establishment thinking in other words imperial collapse is coming it seems an obvious point that talking about combating terrorism without addressing its primary causes and sources of support is somewhat foolish however it appears that trump and his administration need a reminderby far the most striking aspect of trump s announcement however is that it represents a 180 uturn totally reversing the attitude he had to us involvement in afghanistan since before he even began campaigning to become president the following is just one of many tweets dating back quite a few years in which trump complains about the us being in afghanistanwhen will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding afghanistan we must rebuild our country first donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 7 2011trump s announcement is already alienating much of his political base especially supporters who wanted him to prioritize american jobs and infrastructure over globalist projects such as trade deals and foreign wars more than that it is unlikely to be popular with the overall us electorate who are on the whole opposed to continuing the war on the other hand it is no surprise that the announcement is gaining praise from neocons and lawmakers such as sen john mccain raz sen mitch mcconnell rky and house speaker paul ryan rwidoes it even need to be said that the us has had troops deployed to afghanistan for 16 years this might make afghanistan one of the only truly intergenerational wars the us has foughtmet a man today who served in afghanistan 16 yrs ago now says his son serves there let that sink in as you support perpetual war brian j karem briankarem august 22 2017there is of course a question as to how much of this plan is coming from trump himself as opposed to from his advisers deep state handlers or other influences as finian cunningham argues below there is reason to believe that trump has been compromised by the deep state  many even believe that soft coup has occurred and that trump is no longer really in charge yet others question whether trump had any authenticity to begin with on the left especially some people perceive trump to be thoroughly dishonest and merely a representative of robberbaron capitalist fascism these issues are part of the larger question of trump s authenticity but unfortunately we can t provide those answers here whatever one s position on this however none of the possible options lets the president off the hook in all cases he is the man responsible it s his name on the door and it is his responsibility to either make good on his promises to the american people or at the very least to keep them informed in light of his announcement on afghanistan neither one appears to be happeningsee also afghanistan forgotten but not gonemore on this from rt us army soldiers in afghanistan the country has been called the graveyard of empires for being notoriously hard to conquer photo us army source wikicommonsfinian cunningham rtif one moment stands out as the clearest signal yet of us president trump turning his back on supporters it was his announcement this week to reescalate american military intervention in afghanistanhis signature campaign promise of putting america first and ending the folly of overseas wars launched by previous administrations was shredded on prime time television when he gave orders for thousands of more us troops to be sent to afghanistan the already 16year war in that country america s longest will now go on indefinitely longerthe huffington post headlined trump s vague new afghanistan strategy continues an endless war not only that but this president is refusing to give any public information on force numbers or timescale america s overseas wars are not just expanding under trump they are going secret and unaccountablethis surge in militarism is precisely what candidate trump said he would not do when he campaigned for votes among bluecollar workers in the rust belt states vowing instead to channel us economic resources to revive forgotten communities at home recall his blustering inauguration speech on january 20 when he bemoaned the american carnage at home and abroadas the huffington post writes when obama was still in office and overseeing a massive troop presence in afghanistan trump repeatedly bashed the operation as a waste of money and called for a quick withdrawal from the country how s that for a uturn this is at a time when support among trump s voter base in the rust belt states has plummeted there is weakness in the heartland reported nbc because workers fear trump is reneging on past commitments to revitalize their livelihoods their concern is that this president is too interested in giving tax breaks to corporations and kowtowing to the pentagonironically donald trump likes to portray himself as an alphamale who is his own boss it is abundantly clear now that trump is a mere manikin who sits in the white house taking orders from his generalswhen trump ousted stephen bannon his staunchest ally in the white house it was under the orders of the military figures who are now dominant in his administration trump s chief of staff former marine general john kelly wanted bannon out because of his contrarian viewswhen bannon gave a surprise interview last week contradicting the militarist policy on north korea that was the last straw bannon said there was no military option in solving the north korea standoff which flew in the face of what the pentagon has been advising trump with all options on the table only days later he was kicked outbannon has now returned to edit breitbart news the nationalistic website which has in the past served as a media booster for trump following the announcement on afghanistan breitbart news declared trump reverses course and blasted his speech a flipflop as reported by politicobannon had been a vigorous counsel to trump against overseas militarism and in particular about afghanistan he is thought to have been the primary influence behind trump s economic nationalism of america firstit is no coincidence that trump decided to get rid of bannon while huddled with military generals and intelligence chiefs at camp david last weekend then three days after his departure from the white house trump delivers his uturn on reescalating the military involvement in south asia exactly as the pentagon top brass had been urgingwith little or no policy achievements so far trump is emerging as a blowhard who is all too willing to toe the line to survive even if that means stabbing his supposed allies in the back this is a president who has a big mouth and big ego and not much else all the promises to his voter base are being seen to be cruel hoaxes perpetrated by one who is always denouncing others over hoaxesthe rise of the generals in trump s administration alongside a weakkneed figurehead president should surely be cause for concern for its sinister constitutional implications but disturbingly the drift toward a military government in the us hardly causes a public ruffle indeed it is actually welcomed by prominent news mediain an editorial last weekend condemning the failing trump presidency the new york times seems to be oblivious in its endorsement of military control over the white houseit states one measure of the despair caused by mr trump s behavior is that we find ourselves strangely comforted by things that in any normal presidency would be cause for concern americans accustomed constitutionally and politically to civilian leadership now find themselves relying on three current and former generals john kelly the new white house chief of staff h r mcmaster the national security adviser and jim mattis the secretary of defense to stop mr trump from going completely off the rails last week too when the five joint chiefs of staff roundly rebuked trump over his ambiguous comments on racial violence the us media widely saw that intervention by the pentagon as a welcome disciplining of the presidentit s a sobering realitycheck on how the supposed radical populist president who promised to return governing power to the ordinary citizens is now firmly in the vice of a corporatemilitary caballook at trump s cabinet apart from the three generals kelly mcmaster and mattis the other key posts are run by an exoil ceo rex tillerson at the state department and former wall street executives steven mnuchin as treasury secretary gary cohn as national economic adviser and wilbur ross as commerce secretarythis combination of military and industrial corporatism at the executive level of government is a definition of a fascist state combine that with a malleable megalomaniac who is willing to betray his allies and voter base and that makes for a dangerous cabaltrump s readiness to go to war in venezuela north korea and iran and to give license to the pentagon to step up its air force slaughter in iraq syria and yemen are all signals of how far this presidency has degeneratedbut it is trump s brazen backtracking on afghanistan that most transparently shows his unscrupulous character and just how much the pentagon has taken control over this presidencylast november the american people voted for a radical change one that would deliver economic revival and jobs at home while implementing more peaceful foreign relationstoday americans have got the opposite of what they were calling for when they elected president trump the implications are blatant and disconcerting american democracy no longer exists if it ever did the will of the people has been subverted by the will of the militaryindustrial complex trump is but a pathetic puppet who is taking orders from the generals and his oligarchic friends in wall streetthe socalled exceptional nation the one that never tires of proclaiming its lofty democratic virtues to the rest of the world has degenerated into a militarycorporatist state trump s betrayal is complete and stands out as one of the biggest cons in modern political historyread more afghanistan news at 21st century wire

Zakharova Slams CIA Chief Pompeo: Stop Making Up Anti-Russian Fiction,21st century wire says with the ongoing hysteria constantly spouting from the american mainstream media about alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election which saw donald trump elected as president of the united states the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory to date none has surfaced the intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original they ve been doing this for an awfully long time and we are decades into the russians trying to undermine american democracy cia chief mike pompeo told msnbc s hugh hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired saturday june 24russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova has made a noteworthy response to pompeo s commentsvia russia insidertranslation we could not but take note of and comment on the june 24 statement by cia director mike pompeo during his nbc interview the statement dealt with russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the american democracy and meddling in the us elections it appears that in his opinion russia s longtime attempts to undermine the us democracy have culminated in the interference in us elections as we know the issue of russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the united states this story has been adopted by antirussia propagandists this issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to datewe would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of us history unlike the americans we have real facts at our disposal and we know what we should focus on it is common knowledge that since the early 1990s the united states had voiced its intentions to establish a jeffersonian democracy in russia but the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of thomas jefferson one of the founding fathers of the american nation and democracy all of us know he called for respecting various forms of government chosen by other nations and said the united states would not impose its will anywhere he was mistaken thomas jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant brutal and outrageousit appears that the ideologists of the presentday america have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood if the concepts of exporting democracy and humanitarian intervention have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept for decades dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from usimposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern without any consideration for what makes each of them unique this policy and experiments cannot be called harmless in the past few years afghanistan iraq libya egypt syria and ukraine have fallen prey to this concept needless to say alqaeda in all its manifestations isis and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forcesgenerous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and ngos is another grey zone through which the united states has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years russia virtually tops the list of these allocations various government and nongovernment organizations including the peace corps the united states agency for international development usaid the national democratic institute the international republican institute and many other similar agencies have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion according to some sources the us has spent 5 billion dollars for these purposes in the 1990s alone it is very strange that while making such statements mr pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency it is strange that washington forgets the fact that in the runup to the 1996 russian presidential election the federal reserve bank delivered 500 million in cash to the us embassy in moscow under a farfetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old 100 notes operatives from the cia s moscow embassy station headed by michael sulick virtually slept on the money bags while guarding them foreignmade cars delivered small batches of money from the embassy to certain individualswho did the us sponsor using this money i believe we will also learn this someday i do not mean our assumptions everything is clear here well will know the specific names dates and so on here are only a few examples of diverse us activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow american instructions we are in no way demanding that mr pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction one should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction we are ready read more russia news at 21st century wire russia filessupport our work by
